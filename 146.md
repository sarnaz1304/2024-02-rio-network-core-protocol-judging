# Issuer can not update implementations

## Summary

The LRT Issuer is an upgradeable contract and all the contracts it deploys are upgradeable. However, the implementations for all the contracts it deploys are immutable and can no longer be changed after deployment. Since the Issuer is a singleton upgradeable Factory contract that deploys a set of contracts that are also upgradeable, it needs to be able to change the implementations of the LRT contracts it deploys.

## Vulnerability Detail
The implementation contracts are all stored as immutables in the Issuer. Those values are hardcoded in the Issuer's proxy contract as bytecode and it does not change when the Issuer's implementation is changed.

```solidity
    /// @notice The liquid restaking token (LRT) implementation.
    address public immutable tokenImpl;

    /// @notice The LRT coordinator implementation.
    address public immutable coordinatorImpl;

    /// @notice The LRT asset registry implementation.
    address public immutable assetRegistryImpl;

    /// @notice The LRT operator registry implementation.
    address public immutable operatorRegistryImpl;

    /// @notice The LRT AVS registry implementation.
    address public immutable avsRegistryImpl;

    /// @notice The LRT deposit pool implementation.
    address public immutable depositPoolImpl;

    /// @notice The LRT withdrawal queue implementation.
    address public immutable withdrawalQueueImpl;

    /// @notice The LRT reward distributor implementation.
    address public immutable rewardDistributorImpl;
```

This means that the implementation contracts will remain the same for the life of the Issuer and can not be changed after setting them once during deployment.

```solidity
constructor(
    address tokenImpl_,
    address coordinatorImpl_,
    address assetRegistryImpl_,
    address operatorRegistryImpl_,
    address avsRegistryImpl_,
    address depositPoolImpl_,
    address withdrawalQueueImpl_,
    address rewardDistributorImpl_
) {
    _disableInitializers();

    tokenImpl = tokenImpl_;
    coordinatorImpl = coordinatorImpl_;
    assetRegistryImpl = assetRegistryImpl_;
    operatorRegistryImpl = operatorRegistryImpl_;
    avsRegistryImpl = avsRegistryImpl_;
    depositPoolImpl = depositPoolImpl_;
    withdrawalQueueImpl = withdrawalQueueImpl_;
    rewardDistributorImpl = rewardDistributorImpl_;
}
```

## Impact
Any change to the implementations of the LRT contracts can not be reflected on the Issuer. The singleton upgradeable Issuer contract will need to be replaced/rewritten to be able to update the implementations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider replacing the immutables of the implementations with state variables that are initialized. An owner function for changing these implementations would also be necessary so the Issuer can be updated when there are changes to the implementations.
