# Contracts can be re initialised

## Summary
The contracts can be re-initialised by an attacker
## Vulnerability Detail
In the contracts that implemented Openzeppelin’s UUPS model, an uninitialized implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker with the initialize function, it’s recommended to invoke the _disableInitializers function in the constructor to prevent the implementation contract from being used by the attacker.
## Impact
The protocol will not be able to deposit into EIgenLayer

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Prevent the initialise function from being called on the contracts by inheriting from OpenZeppelin's Initializable contract, like the system is doing in other contracts. Call the _disableInitializers function in the constructor and protect initialise with the initializer modifier.
