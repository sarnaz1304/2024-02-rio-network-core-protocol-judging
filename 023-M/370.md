# ETH withdrawers do not earn yield while waiting for a withdrawal

## Summary

In the [ Rio doc](https://docs.rio.network/rio-architecture/deposits-and-withdraws) we can read the following

"Users will continue to earn yield as they wait for their withdrawal request to be processed."

This is not true for withdrawals in ETH since they will simply receive an equivalent to the `sharesOWed` calculated when requesting a withdrawal.
## Vulnerability Detail

When `requestWithdrawal()` is called  to withdraw ETH `sharesOwed` is calculated

```solidity
sharesOwed = convertToSharesFromRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn);
```

The total `sharesOwed` in ETH is added to `epcohWithdrawals.assetsReceived` if we settle with `settleCurrentEpoch()` or `settleEpochFromEigenlayer()` 

Below are the places where `assetsReceived` is is set and accumulated

```solidity
epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived = SafeCast.toUint120(assetsReceived);
```

```solidity
epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived = SafeCast.toUint120(assetsReceived); 
```

```solidity
epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived += SafeCast.toUint120(assetsReceived);
```

when claiming rewards this is used to calculate users share

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L104

```solidity
amountOut = userSummary.sharesOwed.mulDiv(epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived, epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed);

```


The portion of staking rewards accumulated during withdrawal that belongs to LRT holders is never accounted for so withdrawing users do not earn any rewards when waiting for a withdrawal to be completed. 
## Impact

Since a portion of the staking reward belongs to the LRT holders and since the docs mentions that yield is accumulated while in the queue It is fair to assume that withdrawing users have a proportional claim to the yield.

As shown above this is not true, users withdrawing in ETH do no earn any rewards when withdrawing.

## Tool used

Manual Review
## Recommendation

Account for the accumulate rewards during the withdrawal period that belongs to the deposit pool. This can be calculated based on data in DelayedWithdrawalRouter on Eigenlayer.
