# Inflated operator utilization when out-of-order exits are reported can block ETH allocations

## Summary
The Operator Registry prioritizes allocations and deallocations based on operator utilization. When its records of operator utilization is inaccurate it is unable to make correct decisions on allocations and deallocations. At worst, the Operator Registry will not allocate ETH even when an operator should have enough validator cap space.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Operator Registry can handle cases of validators exiting without prompting from the protocol. It does this with `reportOutOfOrderValidatorExits()` which verifies that the given operator's validators were exited and then proceeds to update the operator's exited validators count.

```solidity
function reportOutOfOrderValidatorExits(uint8 operatorId, uint256 fromIndex, uint256 validatorCount) external {
    // ... snip ...

    // Swap the position of the validators starting from the `fromIndex` with the validators that were next in line to be exited.
    VALIDATOR_DETAILS_POSITION.swapValidatorDetails(operatorId, fromIndex, validators.exited, validatorCount);
    operator.validatorDetails.exited += uint40(validatorCount);

    emit OperatorOutOfOrderValidatorExitsReported(operatorId, validatorCount);
}
```

Even though the Operator's exited validators count is updated, it does not update the Operator's utilization. Every validator exit should decrease the utilization of the Operator. This behavior can be seen in `deallocateETHDeposits()`.

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol#L570-L576
```solidity
// ... snip ...
operator.validatorDetails.exited += uint40(newDepositDeallocation);

deallocations[deallocationIndex] = OperatorETHDeallocation(operator.delegator, newDepositDeallocation);
remainingDeposits -= newDepositDeallocation;

uint256 updatedAllocation = activeDeposits - newDepositDeallocation;
heap.updateUtilization(heap.getMaxIndex(), updatedAllocation.divWad(validators.cap));
// ... snip ...
```

## Impact
In this scenario, the Operator Registry's records on operator utilization is no longer accurate. It can no longer properly allocate ETH to the operators with the least utilization. The operator with the inflated utilization due to calling `reportOutOfOrderValidatorExits()` on it, will be incorrectly prioritized for ETH deallocation and de-prioritized for ETH allocation. 

In some cases, this Operator with inflated utilization can no longer be allocated ETH to. For example, the Operator with inflated utilization is still at 100% utilization even after the validator exits and it stored in index 5 in the heap. Another Operator is at 100% utilization but at index 4 in the heap. The Operator at index 4 will always be extracted as the min before the problematic Operator. The index 4 Operator will then stop `allocateETHDeposits()` from attempting to allocate ETH to index 5 Operator since its active deposits is already at capacity.

```solidity
function allocateETHDeposits(uint256 depositsToAllocate) external onlyDepositPool returns (uint256 depositsAllocated, OperatorETHAllocation[] memory allocations) {
    // ... snip ...
    while (remainingDeposits > 0 && !heap.isEmpty()) {
        uint8 operatorId = heap.getMin().id;

        OperatorDetails storage operator = s.operatorDetails[operatorId];
        OperatorValidatorDetails memory validators = operator.validatorDetails;
        uint256 activeDeposits = validators.deposited - validators.exited;

        // If the current deposited validator count of the operator is greater than or equal to its cap,
        // then exit early. We will not be able to allocate to any other operators.
        if (activeDeposits >= validators.cap) break;
    // ... snip ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider updating the Operator's utilization since its number of exited validators has increased. That way, the utilization heap is always up-to-date and the Operator Registry will be making correct decisions on allocation/deallocation based on accurate data.
