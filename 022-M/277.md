# Min excess scrape amount can cause unused ETH and possbily lost LRT tokens for users

## Summary
Min excess scrape amount can cause unused ETH and possbily lost LRT tokens for users

## Vulnerability Detail
When scraping full withdrawal ETH, it is required for the excess amount to be greater than or equal to 1 ether. 

```solidity
    uint256 internal constant MIN_EXCESS_FULL_WITHDRAWAL_ETH_FOR_SCRAPE = 1 ether;

    ...

    function scrapeExcessFullWithdrawalETHFromEigenPod() external {
        uint256 ethWithdrawable = eigenPod.withdrawableRestakedExecutionLayerGwei().toWei();
        uint256 ethQueuedForWithdrawal = getETHQueuedForWithdrawal();
=>      if (ethWithdrawable <= ethQueuedForWithdrawal + MIN_EXCESS_FULL_WITHDRAWAL_ETH_FOR_SCRAPE) {
            revert INSUFFICIENT_EXCESS_FULL_WITHDRAWAL_ETH();
        }
        _queueWithdrawalForOperatorExitOrScrape(BEACON_CHAIN_STRATEGY, ethWithdrawable - ethQueuedForWithdrawal);
    }
```

Hence if the amount is less 1 ether, it cannot be scraped back to deposit pool. This will make this amount unusable if the operator doesn't have other validators that might eventually make this amount usable (eg: if the operator is deactivated). But since this amount will still be included in the total ETH balance calculation of the protocol, it is possible for users to attempt withdrawals such that this amount is required for fulfilling. In such a case, these user's LRT tokens can be effectively lost. Depending on the number of eigen pods having such amounts the loss can become significant

## Impact
1. Unused ETH
2. Possibly locked LRT tokens of user's
