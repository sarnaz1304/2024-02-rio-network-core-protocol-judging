# Settling with Eigenlayer does not update Epoch count, causing the protocol to lock all the funds.

## Summary
To facilitate deposits into EigenLayer and to process 1-day withdrawals from the Rio LRT, there is an automated process that is run called the [Deposit Pool Rebalancer](https://github.com/contracts-and-tooling/source-code/restaking/riolrtcoordinator#rebalance). This function is called via the [Coordinator](https://github.com/rio-architecture/token-issuance#coordinator).

If the amount in the Deposit Pool can not fund the sum of the user's withdrawal requests, then the full withdrawal will be queued for [redemption from EigenLayer](https://github.com/contracts-and-tooling/source-code/restaking/riolrtwithdrawalqueue#settleepochfromeigenlayer). The withdrawal(s) will have the full 7-day EigenLayer withdrawal delay.

## Vulnerability Detail
The rebalance function is critical as it initiates the restaking process into Eigenlayer and facilitates withdrawal from both the deposit pool and Eigenlayer. Within the function, if the deposit pool does not have sufficient assets to support withdrawal, hence the `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue::settleEpochFromEigenLayer` function is called. It fails to increase the epoch count and mark the epoch as settled. After 24 hours, the rebalance function will be triggered again and will **always revert** failing the restaking process into Eigenlayer and facilitates withdrawals.

## Impact
1) Restaked assets will be locked causing stakers to lose their assets. 
2) The protocol is unable to restake the underlying assets into Eigenlayer.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include the missing `currentEpochsByAsset[asset] += 1; ` at the end of the `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue::settleEpochFromEigenLayer` function.
