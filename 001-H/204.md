# `queueCurrentEpochSettlement` does not increment current withdrawal epoch

## Summary
`EpochWithdrawals` are an important part of the Rio network as they keep track of LRTs being swapped for an underlying asset and they also keep track of funds being withdrawn from Eigenlayer. During rebalancing a situation can occur where no more epoch can ever be created again, which means that users can not withdraw fund from the system anymore. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When `RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance()` is called and there are not enough funds in the deposit pool contract then `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.queueCurrentEpochSettlement()` is called. LRT tokens are burned and the current withdrawal  epoch is updated but the `currentEpochsByAsset` is never incremented. From this point on no more new withdrawal epochs can be created.  

## Impact
Users can no longer withdraw funds from the system. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function queueCurrentEpochSettlement(
        address asset,
        uint256 assetsReceived,
        uint256 shareValueOfAssetsReceived,
        bytes32 aggregateRoot
    ) external onlyCoordinator {
        if (aggregateRoot == bytes32(0)) revert INVALID_AGGREGATE_WITHDRAWAL_ROOT();

        uint256 currentEpoch = getCurrentEpoch(asset);

        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(asset, currentEpoch);
        if (epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot != bytes32(0)) revert WITHDRAWALS_ALREADY_QUEUED_FOR_EPOCH();
        if (epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed == 0) revert NO_SHARES_OWED_IN_EPOCH();
        if (epochWithdrawals.settled) revert EPOCH_ALREADY_SETTLED();

        uint256 restakingTokensToBurn;
        if (assetsReceived > 0) {
            epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived = SafeCast.toUint120(assetsReceived);
            epochWithdrawals.shareValueOfAssetsReceived = SafeCast.toUint120(shareValueOfAssetsReceived);

            restakingTokensToBurn = epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement.mulWad(
                shareValueOfAssetsReceived.divWad(epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed)
            );
            token.burn(restakingTokensToBurn);

            epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement -= restakingTokensToBurn;
        }
        epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot = aggregateRoot;

        emit EpochQueuedForSettlementFromEigenLayer(
            currentEpoch, asset, assetsReceived, shareValueOfAssetsReceived, restakingTokensToBurn, aggregateRoot
        );
    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
`queueCurrentEpochSettlement()` needs to increment `currentEpochsByAsset` at the end of the function.
