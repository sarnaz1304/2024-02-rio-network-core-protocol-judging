# Users might receive less funds from the queued withdrawals

## Summary

Users will receive less funds when claiming withdrawals from an epoch that was queued into EigenLayer through `queueCurrentEpochSettlement` if other users request withdrawals in that same epoch.

## Vulnerability Detail

For a user to withdraw funds from the protocol, they must first request a withdrawal using the `requestWithdrawal` function, which will queue the withdrawal in the current epoch by calling `withdrawalQueue().queueWithdrawal`.

All the queued withdrawals will be processed when the `rebalance` function is called. There are two ways to do so (after invoking `_processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch` under the hood):

- The deposit pool has enough funds to cover all the withdrawals, so `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleCurrentEpoch` is called.

- Or the deposit pool can only cover a part of the withdrawal shares, so we must request a withdrawal from EigenLayer by calling `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.queueCurrentEpochSettlement`. The withdrawal can later be completed (after EigenLayer 7 days delay) by calling `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer` to receive the funds from EigenLayer.

The `_processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch` function will handle all the withdrawal logic in the rebalancing call:

```solidity
function _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch(address asset, uint256 sharesOwed) internal {
    IRioLRTWithdrawalQueue withdrawalQueue_ = withdrawalQueue();
    (uint256 assetsSent, uint256 sharesSent) = depositPool().transferMaxAssetsForShares(
        asset,
        sharesOwed,
        address(withdrawalQueue_)
    );
    uint256 sharesRemaining = sharesOwed - sharesSent;

    // Exit early if all pending withdrawals were paid from the deposit pool.
    if (sharesRemaining == 0) {
        withdrawalQueue_.settleCurrentEpoch(asset, assetsSent, sharesSent);
        return;
    }

    address strategy = assetRegistry().getAssetStrategy(asset);
    bytes32 aggregateRoot = OperatorOperations.queueWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(
        operatorRegistry(),
        strategy,
        sharesRemaining
    );

    withdrawalQueue_.queueCurrentEpochSettlement(asset, assetsSent, sharesSent, aggregateRoot);
}
```

In this rebalance process, there is a scenario in which users may receive less funds than expected for their queued withdrawal shares. Let's illustrate that scenario:

- We are currently in epoch 8 (i.e., `getCurrentEpoch() = 8`).

- When `rebalance` gets called, the deposit Pool hasn't enough funds to cover the full withdrawal, so the function must queue withdrawal from operators, and both `RioLRTOperatorDelegator.queueWithdrawalForUserSettlement` and `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.queueCurrentEpochSettlement` will be invoked.

- The `queueCurrentEpochSettlement` will store the asset received from the deposit pool and their corresponding shares value into `epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived` and `epochWithdrawals.shareValueOfAssetsReceived` respectively and will decrement the amount to burn `epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement`.

- After the rebalance, a user requests another withdrawal, and because we are still in the same epoch (epoch was not settled), this withdrawal will get recorded with the currently queued epoch, and the user shares will be added to `epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed`.

- After the `rebalanceDelay` has passed, the `rebalance` function gets called again, and suppose this time also the deposit Pool hasn't enough funds to cover the full withdrawal, the `rebalance` call will revert because the epoch was already queued for withdrawal from EigenLayer in the last rebalance, and thus `queueCurrentEpochSettlement` function will revert because of the following check:

```solidity
if (epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot != bytes32(0)) revert WITHDRAWALS_ALREADY_QUEUED_FOR_EPOCH();
```

- So the request user shares were added to epoch owed shares, but the contract can't request withdrawal for them.

- The `settleCurrentEpoch` function will override the previously set `epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived` and `epochWithdrawals.shareValueOfAssetsReceived` and will burn the remaining `epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement` and will settle the epoch by setting `epochWithdrawals.settled = true`.

- When the epoch is finally settled from EigenLayer by calling `settleEpochFromEigenLayer` function, all shares will be diluted as that added user share didn't get their corresponding asset withdrawn from EigenLayer.

- The result is that all users will receive less funds than expected because they must share the received asset funds with that user who was added after the epoch was already queued, this is illustrated by the amountout which will be lower as the sharesOwed will be more than what was expected:

```solidity
amountOut = userSummary.sharesOwed.mulDiv(epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived, epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed);
```

- Note that the received asset will be further diluted as more users request a withdrawal after the epoch was already queued.

## Impact

Users will receive less funds when claiming withdrawals from an epoch that was queued into EigenLayer through `queueCurrentEpochSettlement` if other users request withdrawals in that same epoch after it was queued.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, the simplest method is to increment the epoch `currentEpochsByAsset` when `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.queueCurrentEpochSettlement` is called. Requests for withdrawals made after queuing will be recorded in the next epoch.
