# Epoch is not incremented when withdrawing from EigenLayer

## Summary

The epoch is not incremented when withdrawals happen through EigenLayer, users will lose their assets since they can not complete their withdrawals. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When we settle through `settleCurrentEpoch()` we increment `currentEpochsByAsset[asset]`.

```solidity
currentEpochsByAsset[asset] += 1;
```

But If we  withdraw from EigenLayer by calling `queueWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement()` we never increment the epoch.

## Impact

Rebalance mechanism is broken:

When an epoch withdrawing from eigenlayer it is settled through `settleEpochFromEigenLayer()`, `epochWithdrawals.settled` is set to `true`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L230

Users will still be able to call `requestWithdrawl()` even if the current epoch has settled, they will lose their LRT tokens but the epoch is already settled so the funds are stuck.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The epoch has to be incremented when we queue it for settlement in `_processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch()`

```solidity
withdrawalQueue_.queueCurrentEpochSettlement(asset, assetsSent, sharesSent, aggregateRoot);

currentEpochsByAsset[asset] += 1;
```
