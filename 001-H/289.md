# `currentEpochsByAsset` must be increased by 1 in `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.queueCurrentEpochSettlement()`.

## Summary

When calling `RIOLrtCoordinator.rebalance(asset)`, if there is no enough assets for `sharesOwed` of current epoch in `RIOLrtDepositPool`, `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()` is called. However the `currentEpochsByAsset` is not increased by 1. Thus, the current epoch of the asset is not be updated.

```javascript
    function queueCurrentEpochSettlement(
        address asset,
        uint256 assetsReceived,
        uint256 shareValueOfAssetsReceived,
        bytes32 aggregateRoot
    ) external onlyCoordinator {
        if (aggregateRoot == bytes32(0)) revert INVALID_AGGREGATE_WITHDRAWAL_ROOT();


        uint256 currentEpoch = getCurrentEpoch(asset);


        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(asset, currentEpoch);
        if (epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot != bytes32(0)) revert WITHDRAWALS_ALREADY_QUEUED_FOR_EPOCH();
        if (epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed == 0) revert NO_SHARES_OWED_IN_EPOCH();
        if (epochWithdrawals.settled) revert EPOCH_ALREADY_SETTLED();


        uint256 restakingTokensToBurn;
        if (assetsReceived > 0) {
            epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived = SafeCast.toUint120(assetsReceived);
            epochWithdrawals.shareValueOfAssetsReceived = SafeCast.toUint120(shareValueOfAssetsReceived);


            restakingTokensToBurn = epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement.mulWad(
                shareValueOfAssetsReceived.divWad(epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed)
            );
            token.burn(restakingTokensToBurn);


            epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement -= restakingTokensToBurn;
        }
        epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot = aggregateRoot;


        emit EpochQueuedForSettlementFromEigenLayer(
            currentEpoch, asset, assetsReceived, shareValueOfAssetsReceived, restakingTokensToBurn, aggregateRoot
        );
    }
```
As you can see in the above code, the `currentEpochsByAsset` is not increased and since there is not enough asset for users withdrawal in the deposit pool the additional asset is required from the eigen layer and the `settleEpochFromEigenLayer` function is called.

At L230 `epochWithdrawals.settled` is set as true. So upcoming user's deposit will be succeed but withdrawal will be failed because the `currentEpochsByAsset` is not updated and it is settled as true.

## Impact

When `RioLRTCoordinator.requestWithdrawal()` is called, LRT tokens of users will be successfully transfered to the protocol. However, `RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance()` will revert because the `currentEpochsByAsset` is not increased and `_getEpochWithdrawals(asset, currentEpoch).settled` is true. So, users cannot take back their assets. 
`RioLRTCoordinator.deposit()` can still work with the assets and this make it worse.
