# currentEpochsByAsset Must Increase In queueCurrentEpochSettlement

## Summary

 When a withdrawal is settled from the Eigen Layer Side (deposit pool was unable to settle the withdrawal) then the `currentEpochsByAsset` is not incremented leading to a number of issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a withdrawal is settled from the Eigen Layer Side (deposit pool was unable to settle the withdrawal) then the `currentEpochsByAsset` is not incremented leading to a number of issues -> 
  
  1.) rebalance() is called https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L121
  
  2.)  it calls` _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch()`   , but deposit pool didnt have enough assets to settle the epoch so queueCurrentEpochSettlement() is called at L266 to queue the withdrawal via EigenLayer. Keep note that currentEpochsByAsset[asset] is not changed , therefore currentEpoch is same.
  
  3.) After some time the epoch can be settled and  settleEpochFromEigenLayer() is called https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L216
  , assets are sent to the withdrwal queue for the users to claim their withdrawals.
  
  4.)  Since after settlement  getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch is the same (cause getEpochWithdrawals is same since epoch is not updated) then when we call rebalance() again to settle withdrawals , it reads the old value from the withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset); and attempts to transfer assets prev owed from the deposit pool even though it is settled.
 
  5.) This will keep the deposit pool send funds owed in prev epochs cause currentEpoch still point to same epoch , until the 
  epoch is settled via the deposit pool and settleCurrentEpoch is called https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L256
  . 

  6.) Another problem that might occur is , if rebalance() is called again after some time , `_processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch()` is called and still deposit pool didnt have enough to cover the sharesOwed  , so we get to queueCurrentEpochSettlement() again and do epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived = SafeCast.toUint120(assetsReceived); , this would override the assetReceived set previously for the epoch , therefore this would store the incorrect value for assetsReceived.

## Impact

 Incorrect update of currentEpochsByAsset[asset] leads to the epoch not getting updated even after settlement and the sharesOWed and assetReceived would be incorrect.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

  Update the currentEpochsByAsset[asset] in the queueCurrentEpochSettlement()
