# Epoch is not increased when settlement is queued.

## Summary
If the current epoch settlement is queued (`RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.queueCurrentEpochSettlement()`), the epoch won't move forward, causing the asset's epoch to remain stuck indefinitely. This blocks any future deposits or withdrawals involving that asset.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance()` is called, there are only two possible outcomes:

1. If there's enough funds in the depositPool to cover all withdrawals, `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleCurrentEpoch()` gets called.
2. If the depositPool doesn't have sufficient funds, a withdrawal from Eigenlayer is requested through `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.queueCurrentEpochSettlement()`, followed by `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer()`.

However, in the second scenario, the current epoch for that asset doesn't increase either during `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()` or `settleEpochFromEigenLayer()`. Consequently, after `settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` runs, the epoch remains at its initial value from before the rebalance. Even though the withdrawals for that epoch are marked as settled (`epochwithdrawals.settled`), thus it becomes impossible to settle again, effectively freezing the asset's epoch at a stage where no further rebalances can occur.

See POC below.

## Impact
Epoch is not increased when settlement is queued. This freezing of the asset's epoch prevents any future rebalance, thereby hindering future deposits or withdrawals involving that asset.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider increasing the current epoch when settlement is queued, as it is correctly done in
`RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleCurrentEpoch()`.
