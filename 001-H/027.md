# Eigenlayer withdrawals brick future withdrawals due to no update of current epoch

## Summary
When withdrawals are processed in the LRT, fulfilling the withdrawals may require assets to be withdrawn from Eigenlayer. However, when this happens, any subsequent rebalances and withdrawals will get bricked and depositors will no longer be able to retrieve their assets because the current epoch will not be updated.

## Vulnerability Detail
Settling a current epoch for an assets updates it current epoch by adding 1.

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L147-L169
```solidity
function settleCurrentEpoch(address asset, uint256 assetsReceived, uint256 shareValueOfAssetsReceived)
    external
    onlyCoordinator
{
    // ... snip ...
    currentEpochsByAsset[asset] += 1;

    emit EpochSettledFromDepositPool(currentEpoch, asset, assetsReceived);
}
```

However, settling the epoch via Eigenlayer does not update the current epoch and just sets the epoch to `settled`. Since the current epoch for the asset hasn't been updated, any subsequent queued withdrawals will still be recorded for the same epoch even if that epoch has already been settled.

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L130-L145
```solidity
    function queueWithdrawal(address withdrawer, address asset, uint256 sharesOwed, uint256 amountIn)
        external
        onlyCoordinator
    {
        if (sharesOwed == 0) revert NO_SHARES_OWED();
        uint256 currentEpoch = getCurrentEpoch(asset);

        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(asset, currentEpoch);
        epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed += SafeCast.toUint120(sharesOwed);
        epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement += amountIn; // restaking tokens

        UserWithdrawalSummary storage userSummary = epochWithdrawals.users[withdrawer];
        userSummary.sharesOwed += SafeCast.toUint120(sharesOwed);

        emit WithdrawalQueued(currentEpoch, asset, withdrawer, sharesOwed, amountIn);
    }
```

Any attempts to settle the epoch again would fail because the current epoch has already been settled.

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L159
```solidity
    function settleCurrentEpoch(address asset, uint256 assetsReceived, uint256 shareValueOfAssetsReceived)
        external
        onlyCoordinator
    {
        // ... snip ...
        if (epochWithdrawals.settled) revert EPOCH_ALREADY_SETTLED();
        // ... snip ...
    }
```

## Impact

Settling the current epoch for an asset but not changing it to the next one will brick that asset's rebalances every time withdrawals are processed. All future withdrawal requests for that asset will be queued in the settled epoch and will never be processed. Since rebalancing is bricked, depositors will be unable to withdraw their assets from the LRT.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the following line to `WithdrawalQueue::settleEpochFromEigenlayer()`.
```solidity
currentEpochsByAsset[asset] += 1;
```
