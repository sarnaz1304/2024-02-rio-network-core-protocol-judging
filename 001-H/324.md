# `currentEpochsByAsset` is not increased in `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.queueCurrentEpochSettlement()`

## Summary
When there are not enough assets to fulfill `sharesOwed` of the current epoch in the deposit pool, `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()` is called. After that, a new epoch should be used for later withdrawal requests but it will overwrite the current epoch as the `currentEpochsByAsset` is not increased in `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the epoch is settled quickly using the deposit pool's assets, `currentEpochsByAsset` is [increased properly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L166).

But when it requests assets from EigenLayer using `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()`, it doesn't increase the epoch and the withdrawal mechanism would work unexpectedly.

- The current epoch is 100 and it has positive `sharesOwed` now.
- During `RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance()`, `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()` is called as the deposit pool doesn't contain enough funds.
- So the epoch(=100) has the `aggregateRoot` for claiming [sharesRemaining](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L264) of the already requested withdrawals and this epoch's info shouldn't be changed anymore.
- After that, if a user requests a new withdrawal again, it will change this epoch's [amounts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L142).
- Furthermore, after this epoch is settled in `settleEpochFromEigenLayer()`, users will request a withdrawal with an already settled epoch as the epoch is not increased. It means the epoch logic will be broken.

## Impact
After calling `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()`, the withdrawal mechanism will be broken as it doesn't increase the epoch.

## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
`queueCurrentEpochSettlement()` should increase the `currentEpochsByAsset` mapping after requesting a withdrawal from EigenLayer.

```diff

            restakingTokensToBurn = epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement.mulWad(
                shareValueOfAssetsReceived.divWad(epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed)
            );
            token.burn(restakingTokensToBurn);


            epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement -= restakingTokensToBurn;
        }
        epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot = aggregateRoot;
+       currentEpochsByAsset[asset] += 1;


        emit EpochQueuedForSettlementFromEigenLayer(
            currentEpoch, asset, assetsReceived, shareValueOfAssetsReceived, restakingTokensToBurn, aggregateRoot
        );
    }
