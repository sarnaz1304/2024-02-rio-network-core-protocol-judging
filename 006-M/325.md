# Users can request withdrawal without limit since `availableShares` is calculated incorrectly in `requestWithdrawal` function

## Summary
When a user submits a withdrawal request, but there aren't enough shares available, the transaction should be reversed due to insufficient shares for withdrawal. The `availableShares` includes all assets present in the deposit pool and eigen layer, as well as queued withdrawals. However, it decreases the current epoch's outstanding shares, enabling users to make withdrawal requests without restrictions.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `requestWithdrawal` function of `RioLRTCoordinator` contract, they check if there are enough shares to cover the withdrawal request.
```solidity
    function requestWithdrawal(address asset, uint256 amountIn) external checkWithdrawal(asset, amountIn) returns (uint256 sharesOwed) {
        // Determine the amount of shares owed to the withdrawer using the current exchange rate.
        sharesOwed = convertToSharesFromRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn);

        // If requesting ETH, reduce the precision of the shares owed to the nearest Gwei,
        // which is the smallest unit of account supported by EigenLayer.
        if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) sharesOwed = sharesOwed.reducePrecisionToGwei();

        // Pull restaking tokens from the sender to the withdrawal queue.
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(withdrawalQueue()), amountIn);

        // Ensure there are enough shares to cover the withdrawal request, and queue the withdrawal.
        uint256 availableShares = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, assetRegistry().getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset));
@>      if (sharesOwed > availableShares - withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset)) {
            revert INSUFFICIENT_SHARES_FOR_WITHDRAWAL();
        }
        withdrawalQueue().queueWithdrawal(msg.sender, asset, sharesOwed, amountIn);
    }
```
However, in the checking, they don't decrease `availableShares` by previous queued withdrawals. This makes users enable to bypass the restriction and request withdrawal without limit.

## Impact
Users can request withdrawal and queue without limit bypassing the restriction since the previous queued withdrawals isn't decreased in the checking of `requestWithdrawal` function.

## Recommendation
Previous queued withdrawal must be decreased from `availableShares` in `requestWithdrawal` function.
