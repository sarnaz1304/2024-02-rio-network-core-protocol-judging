# overstated TVL value breaks share accounting when asset are queued for withdrawal form `EigenLayer`

## Summary
In the `RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol` contract, the `getTVL()` function is used to calculate the total value of all underlying asset in the unit of account, however the returned value is inflated due to improper evaluation

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, the TVL of the unit of account is calculated as the sum of asset currently held in the the `EigenLayer` and `RioLRTDepositPool.sol` contracts respectively. This done by summing the value returned by `RioLRTAssetRegistry::getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset)` for all assets in the unit of account. 

The problem is that the resulting value for `getTVL()` does not take into consideration value of the asset in the in the withdrawal queue *WHEN* the balance of the `RioLRTDepositPool.sol` is not enough to settle the requested deposit 
For instance:
- Before Withdrawal Request
    - Asset in `EigenLayer` / strategy = 100 ether:
    - Asset in `RioLRTDepositPool.sol` = 10 ether
    - withdrawal request = 0
    - Correct TVL = 110 ether. 
    
- On withdrawal request within 7 days of  settlement from `EigenLayer`
    - Asset in `EigenLayer` / strategy = 100 ether:
    - Asset in `RioLRTDepositPool.sol` = 10 ether
    - withdrawal request = 30 ether
    - Wrong TVL = 110 ether

Notice that the TVL remains the same and still contains asset that are queued to be withdrawn from `EigenLayer` or it strategy despite queueing the asset for withdrawal.
This value of the returned `TVL` is used extensively in the evaluation of shares during deposit and withdrawals. 

## Impact
The `TVL` for the unit of account is evaluated wrongly and this breaks accounting of share values with can lead to loss of funds for the users or can be exploited by an attacker in the event that the share values are overstated

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider subtracting the queued withdrawals in the `RioLRTAssetRegistry::getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset)` function especially when the requested withdrawal cannot be settled by the funds in the deposit pool.
