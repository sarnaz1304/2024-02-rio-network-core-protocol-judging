# Wrong calculation of `availableShares` in `RioLRTCoordinator.requestWithdrawal`

## Summary
Because of the wrong calculation of `availableShares` in `requestWithdrawal` users can request withdrawal more than the capavility of the protocol
## Vulnerability Detail

```javascript
    function requestWithdrawal(address asset, uint256 amountIn) external checkWithdrawal(asset, amountIn) returns (uint256 sharesOwed) {
        // Determine the amount of shares owed to the withdrawer using the current exchange rate.
        sharesOwed = convertToSharesFromRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn);

        // If requesting ETH, reduce the precision of the shares owed to the nearest Gwei,
        // which is the smallest unit of account supported by EigenLayer.
        if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) sharesOwed = sharesOwed.reducePrecisionToGwei();

        // Pull restaking tokens from the sender to the withdrawal queue.
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(withdrawalQueue()), amountIn);

        // Ensure there are enough shares to cover the withdrawal request, and queue the withdrawal.
@>111   uint256 availableShares = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, assetRegistry().getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset));
@>112   if (sharesOwed > availableShares - withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset)) {
            revert INSUFFICIENT_SHARES_FOR_WITHDRAWAL();
        }
        withdrawalQueue().queueWithdrawal(msg.sender, asset, sharesOwed, amountIn);
    }
```
At [L112](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L111) `availableShares` contain all assets in deposit pool and the eigen layer. But in the next line[L112](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L112) only shares owed in current epoch is reduced from the `availableShares` and it doesn't take accout the previous queued withdrawals. In other words the inequality at L112 will never happen and every request withdrawal will be queued and the protocol doesn't have the capability to handle them all.

## Impact
Every request withdrawal will be queued regardless the `availableShares` and this will break the protocol

## Code Snippet
Every request withdrawal will be queued regardless the `availableShares` and this will break the protocol
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should consider the previous queued withdrawal when calculating the `availableShares`
