# Deactivating operators doesn't clear it's strategy allocations

## Summary
Deactivating operators doesn't clear it's strategy allocations

## Vulnerability Detail
When operators are deactivated, its strategy allocations are not cleared although its cap and utilization is handled.

Updates the cap by calling setOperatorStrategyCap
```solidity
    function deactivateOperator(
        RioLRTOperatorRegistryStorageV1.StorageV1 storage s,
        IRioLRTAssetRegistry assetRegistry,
        uint8 operatorId
    ) external {
        
        ....

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < strategies.length; ++i) {
=>          s.setOperatorStrategyCap(
                operatorId, IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.StrategyShareCap({strategy: strategies[i], cap: 0})
            );
        }
```

setOperatorStrategyCap doesn't clear allocation
```solidity
    function setOperatorStrategyCap(
        RioLRTOperatorRegistryStorageV1.StorageV1 storage s,
        uint8 operatorId,
        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.StrategyShareCap memory newShareCap
    ) internal {
        
        ....

        if (currentShareDetails.cap > 0 && newShareCap.cap == 0) {
            // If the operator has allocations, queue them for exit.
=>          if (currentShareDetails.allocation > 0) {
                operatorDetails.queueOperatorStrategyExit(operatorId, newShareCap.strategy);
            }
            // Remove the operator from the utilization heap.
            utilizationHeap.removeByID(operatorId);
        } else if (currentShareDetails.cap == 0 && newShareCap.cap > 0) {
```

If this operator is re-activated, it will incorrectly have the previous uncleared amount of allocation as its current allocation which will cause the strategy shares allocation and deallocation functions to work incorrectly. 
For eg, if the new cap is set to an amount lower than the previous allocation, then it will disallow all deposits to eigen layer for the strategy as this operator could be on the top of the heap (its utilization will be set to 0 when reactivating) and the allocation function will exit without deposting any amount to EigenLayer.   

It would also not be possible to further deactivate this operator since when deactivating, the wrong allocation amount will make it attempt to withdraw that much amount of shares from EigenLayer which will cause it to revert

## Impact
If an operator is deactivated and reactivated again, 
1. Deposits will fail
2. The operator cannot be deactivated again

## Code Snippet
deactivateOperator calls setOperatorStrategyCap to update cap and doesn't clear allocation
