# Operatorid will not be removed properly from a strategy.

## Summary
When  function _remove(OperatorUtilizationHeap contract) is called to remove an operatorid,the operatorid’s index is not replaced properly with the last index and the last index is not removed.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let’s assume a strategy has 4 operatorids i.e total index = 4 and count = 4.
2. function remove is called with index 2 which calls _remove function.
3. See function _remove,
 self.operators[2] = self.operators[3] i.e operator in index 2 becomes operator in index 3.
4. Now updated operators = [1,2,3,4] where the middle two operatorid is same and count is updated to 3.so operatoid in index 4 will become useless.

## Impact
Operatorid in index 4 will be useless as function updateUtilization will not work for index 4 as now operatorids count = 3.

## Recommendation
Replace the index properly with the last index and then remove the last index.
