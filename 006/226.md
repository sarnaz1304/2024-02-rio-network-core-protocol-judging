# MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT is not checked everywhere

## Summary
In `OperatorRegistryV1Admin` library, there exists a potential oversight where the `MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT` constraint is not enforced during operator activation. This could lead to an excess of active operators within the system

## Vulnerability Detail
The `RioLRTOperatorRegistry` contract utilizes the `OperatorRegistryV1Admin` library to manage operators within the system, setting a clear maximum on the number of active operators allowed (`MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT` = 64). However, during the activation of an operator via the `activateOperator` function, there is no check to ensure that activating an additional operator does not exceed this maximum limit. 
Due to the fact that operators are activated by default, this function is a proof that an operator could be toggled on and off sometimes without a required check whether MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT is not overpassed.
```solidity
function activateOperator(RioLRTOperatorRegistryStorageV1.StorageV1 storage s, uint8 operatorId) external {
    IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorDetails storage operator = s.operatorDetails[operatorId];
    
    if (operator.delegator == address(0)) revert IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.INVALID_OPERATOR_DELEGATOR();
    if (operator.active) revert IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OPERATOR_ALREADY_ACTIVE();

    operator.active = true;
    s.activeOperatorCount += 1;

    emit IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorActivated(operatorId);
}
```

## Impact
Break of a core invariant of the protocol

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Amend the `activateOperator` function to include a check against `MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT` before activating an additional operator. This ensures compliance with predefined system limits.
