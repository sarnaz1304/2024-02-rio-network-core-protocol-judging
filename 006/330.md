# There is no `MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT` validation in `OperatorRegistryV1Admin.activateOperator()`.

## Summary
There is no `MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT` validation in `OperatorRegistryV1Admin.activateOperator()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `addOperator()`, there is a validation of [MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorRegistryV1Admin.sol#L50).

But in `activateOperator()`, it doesn't validate and there might be more active operators like the below.

- There are 64(MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT) active operators now.
- The admin deactivates one operator and adds a new one. So 64 active operators again.
- After that, `activateOperator()` is called with the deactivated operator and we have 65 operators unexpectedly.

## Impact
There might be more active operators than `MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
`OperatorRegistryV1Admin.activateOperator()` should check the `MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT` requirement.
