# Immutable Variables in Upgradeable Contracts

## Summary
Immutable variables in upgradeable contracts, especially those utilizing a proxy pattern such as UUPS or Transparent Proxy, introduce risks and limitations that could affect contract functionality and upgradability

## Vulnerability Detail
Involved Contracts:
- `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue`
- `RioLRTIssuer`
- `RioLRTOperatorRegistry`
- `RioLRTDepositPool`

Immutable variables are set once during contract creation and cannot be changed afterward. They are designed to be used in contracts where the value should not change after deployment. However, in the context of upgradeable contracts that separate logic (implementation) and state (proxy), using immutable variables poses several challenges like initialization challenges or upgrade Limitation

## Impact
Design limitations and increase the complexity of contract upgrades
