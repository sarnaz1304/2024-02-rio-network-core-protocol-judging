# RioLRTOperatorDelegator:initialize calls delegateTo at the delegationManager contract with a 0 timestamp expiry and a 0 bytes signature

## Summary
The RioLRTOperatorDelegator contract initialize function is not properly integrated to EigenLayer's delegation manager, which leads to reversion during initialization.
## Vulnerability Detail
By calling the delegateTo method at the DelegationManager, the following code snippet is executed:
```solidity
_delegate(msg.sender, operator, approverSignatureAndExpiry, approverSalt);
```

This delegate function has a check to ensure the expiry is bigger or equal to the current timestamp:
```soldity
function _delegate(
        address staker,
        address operator,
        SignatureWithExpiry memory approverSignatureAndExpiry,
        bytes32 approverSalt
    ){
...
require(
                approverSignatureAndExpiry.expiry >= block.timestamp,
                "DelegationManager._delegate: approver signature expired"
            );
...
}
```

It also checks if the signature is valid:
```solidity
EIP1271SignatureUtils.checkSignature_EIP1271(
                _delegationApprover,
                approverDigestHash,
                approverSignatureAndExpiry.signature
            );
```

During the initialization, the SignatureWithExpiry argument has zero as the value for both the signature and the expiry:
```solidity
delegationManager.delegateTo(
            operator,
            ISignatureUtils.SignatureWithExpiry(new bytes(0), 0),
            bytes32(0)
        );
```

This means the delegateTo call will revert as both the expiry and the signature provided will fail the checks.
## Impact
The delegateTo call will revert, meaning no delegations will be possible and the OperatorDelegator initialization will revert with the "DelegationManager. delegate: approver signature expired" error.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure to have an expiry that is at least equal to the current block timestamp. Consider setting expiry of at least 6 months to ensure the contract can be utilized for an extended period of time.
