# Shares associated with operator exits are not marked unwithdrawable

## Summary
Shares associated with operator exits are not marked unwithdrawable

## Vulnerability Detail
When an operator exits, the shares associated with the operator is only cleared once the withdrawal from EigenLayer completes and the assets reach the depositPool

```solidity
    function completeOperatorWithdrawalForAsset(
        address asset,
        uint8 operatorId,
        IDelegationManager.Withdrawal calldata queuedWithdrawal,
        uint256 middlewareTimesIndex
    ) external {
        
        ....
       
        // @audit the associated shares are cleared here. similar for eth

        } else {
            assetRegistry().decreaseSharesHeldForAsset(asset, queuedWithdrawal.shares[0]);
        }

```

During this time period, for user's attempting to withdraw it would seem as if this amount of shares is available to withdraw. This will cause the `rebalance` function to revert until the operator's withdrawal associated amount reaches depositPool. User's withdrawing would expect a total time of (rebalance delay ~1 day + eigen layer delay, max 7 days) to complete the withdrawal. But since the operator's queued withdrawal amount can take ~ 7 days to reach the deposit pool, it is possible for the withdrawal to take ~14 days to complete.  

## Impact
When deposits doesn't cover the entire withdrawal amount, rebalance can revert and cause withdrawals to take twice (ie.~14 days instead of ~7 days) as much time to complete

## Code Snippet
Shares associated with an operator exit is only cleared once the withdrawal is complete and is not marked non-withdrawable

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Account for the currently queued operator withdrawals and decrease it from the withdraw-able shares
