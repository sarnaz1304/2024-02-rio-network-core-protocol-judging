# Aggregate Root could Mismatch in Withdrawal Processing

## Summary
During the settlement process there are some scenarios where complete withdrawal could not happen, which would prevent any ETH rebalance

## Vulnerability Detail
The complete process for withdrawing ETH is like this : 
1. request Withdrawal using requestWithdrawal() 
2. Rebalance() is called for ETH , which call `_processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch` which call `queueWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement()`  : 
```solidity
function _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch(address asset, uint256 sharesOwed) internal {
        //// ..... ////

        address strategy = assetRegistry().getAssetStrategy(asset);
        bytes32 aggregateRoot = OperatorOperations.queueWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(
            operatorRegistry(),
            strategy,
            sharesRemaining
        );
        withdrawalQueue_.queueCurrentEpochSettlement(asset, assetsSent, sharesSent, aggregateRoot);
    }
```
3. queueWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement will call `queueETHWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement()`
```solidity
    function queueWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(
        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry operatorRegistry,
        address strategy,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal returns (bytes32 aggregateRoot) {
        if (strategy == BEACON_CHAIN_STRATEGY) {
            return queueETHWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(operatorRegistry, amount);
        }
        return queueTokenWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(operatorRegistry, strategy, amount);
    }
function queueETHWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(IRioLRTOperatorRegistry operatorRegistry, uint256 amount) internal returns (bytes32 aggregateRoot) {
        uint256 depositCount = amount.divUp(ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE);
        (, IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorETHDeallocation[] memory operatorDepositDeallocations) = operatorRegistry.deallocateETHDeposits(
            depositCount
        );
        uint256 length = operatorDepositDeallocations.length;
        bytes32[] memory roots = new bytes32[](length);

        uint256 remainingAmount = amount;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            address delegator = operatorDepositDeallocations[i].delegator;

            // Ensure we do not send more than needed to the withdrawal queue. The remaining will stay in the Eigen Pod.
            uint256 amountToWithdraw = (i == length - 1) ? remainingAmount : operatorDepositDeallocations[i].deposits * ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE;

            remainingAmount -= amountToWithdraw;
            roots[i] = IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(delegator).queueWithdrawalForUserSettlement(BEACON_CHAIN_STRATEGY, amountToWithdraw);
        }
        aggregateRoot = keccak256(abi.encode(roots));
    }
```
Here as you can see ETH is deallocated from operator validators, however in case of slashing or an operator exited EigenLayer outside of Rio protocol , the protocol could face a scenario where there wasn't enough amount of ETH to withdraw.
In this case the process would continue, effectively queueing withdrawals from EigenLayer side and computing an aggregated root that is not equal to the one expected below because yes Operator can deallocate ETH but doesn't account ETH slashed or exited outside of the protocol, then computing an aggregatedRoot that won't be the same as the one computed during real epoch settlement : 
5. Then withdrawalQueue_.queueCurrentEpochSettlement() will be called to store aggregatedRoot 
```solidity
function queueCurrentEpochSettlement(address asset,uint256 assetsReceived,uint256 shareValueOfAssetsReceived,bytes32 aggregateRoot) external onlyCoordinator 
    {
        /// ... ///
        epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot = aggregateRoot;
        /// ... ///
    }
```
6. And finally, when EigenLayer could complete withdrawals, settleEpochFromEigenLayer() will be called to complete the process
```solidity
function settleEpochFromEigenLayer(
        address asset,
        uint256 epoch,
        IDelegationManager.Withdrawal[] calldata queuedWithdrawals,
        uint256[] calldata middlewareTimesIndexes
    ) external {
        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(asset, epoch);
        if (epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed == 0) revert NO_SHARES_OWED_IN_EPOCH();
        if (epochWithdrawals.settled) revert EPOCH_ALREADY_SETTLED();
        if (epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot == bytes32(0)) revert WITHDRAWALS_NOT_QUEUED_FOR_EPOCH();

        /// ... ///

        address[] memory assets = asset.toArray();
        bytes32[] memory roots = new bytes32[](queuedWithdrawalCount);

        IDelegationManager.Withdrawal memory queuedWithdrawal;
        for (uint256 i; i < queuedWithdrawalCount; ++i) {
            queuedWithdrawal = queuedWithdrawals[i];

            roots[i] = _computeWithdrawalRoot(queuedWithdrawal);
            /// ... ///
            }
        }
        if (epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot != keccak256(abi.encode(roots))) {
            revert INVALID_AGGREGATE_WITHDRAWAL_ROOT();
        }
        /// ... ///
    }
```
Here as you can see `roots` computed regarding all the withdrawals requests is computed to check if it match from what was submitted to be withdrawn from EigenLayer but if operators deallocated or ETH withdrawn is not the same amount it will revert

## Impact
Rebalance process permanently DOSed for ETH

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement kind of fallBack mechanism to proceed with withdrawals that can be handled and push the others for another epoch maybe
Or set a requirement for queueing strictly what is needed in the same way as shares for ERC20 is implemented
