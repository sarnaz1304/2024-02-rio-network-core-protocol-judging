# Malicious actor can set himself as `proofUploader`, lacks `access control`

## Summary
Malicious actor can set himself as `proofUploader`, lacks `access control` in `OperatorRegistryV1Admin::setProofUploader()`

## Vulnerability Detail
ProofUploader verifies withdrawal credentials of validator(s) owned by the provided operator's EigenPod by calling `RioLRTOperatorRegistry::verifyWithdrawalCredentials()` and this proofUploader is set by `onlyOwner`. setProofUploader in operatorRegistry contract uses a library to set proofUploader ie `OperatorRegistryV1Admin::setProofUploader()` but this library function lacks access control ie malicious actor can directly call this `OperatorRegistryV1Admin::setProofUploader()` and set himself as a proofUploader.
```solidity
    function setProofUploader(address newProofUploader) external onlyOwner {
        s.setProofUploader(newProofUploader);
    }
```
```solidity
    function setProofUploader(RioLRTOperatorRegistryStorageV1.StorageV1 storage s, address newProofUploader) external {
// lacks access control
        s.proofUploader = newProofUploader;

        emit IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.ProofUploaderSet(newProofUploader);
    }
```
## Impact
Malicious actor can became a proofUploader
