# Users can still request withdrawals and rebalance when settlement is queued.

## Summary
Because epoch is not increased after `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.queueCurrentEpochSettlement()`, further withdrawal requests and rebalances  to an epoch who has its settlement queued are still possible, consequently resulting is loss of funds to the users and to the protocol. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When there aren't enough funds in the deposit pool to pay all withdrawals requests, withdrawal is requested from Eigenlayer and settlement is queued by `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.queueCurrentEpochSettlement()` . However  `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()`  does not increase the epoch.

As the epoch has not ended, this leads to two possible situations. Both of which has damaging consequences, as it will be described further.
1) users can still request withdrawals to that epoch, even though that withdrawal has already been queued at Eigenlayer.
2) user can call `rebalance` again even though settlement is already queued.

Consider the first situation. After settlement is queued, users can still request withdrawals, as a result `epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed` will be increased, but the funds received won't be increased (as it was defined at the time `RioLRTCoordinator._processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch()` was executed). As a consequence not enough funds will be withdrawn from Eigenlayer and users will receive less funds than expected. See POC below:

```

The second scenario occurs because the interval required to get funds from Eigenlayer is bigger (7 days) than the delay needed to call `RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance()` again. As epoch was not increased after `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()`, it is possible to wait until the rebalance delay has passed and then call `rebalance()`  again. If during this second call to `rebalance()` there is enough funds in the deposit pool, then the epoch will be settled even though the Eigenlayer withdraw is still queued and also setting `epochWithdrawals.settled` to true. Therefore when `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue. settleEpochFromEigenLayer` is called it will revert  and those funds will be stuck at Eigenlayer as the withdrawal can never be completed. See POC below:

## Impact
Loss of funds to the users and to the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Both situations require different remediations, consider blocking further withdrawals request when settlement is queued. Regarding rebalances, block `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleCurrentEpoch()` to be called when settlement is queued.
