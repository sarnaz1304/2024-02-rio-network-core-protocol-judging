# Increase in Eigenlayer strategies shares value might lead `rebalance()` reverting

## Summary
Increase in Eigenlayer strategies shares value might lead to inconsistencies, reverts and loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
To withdraw funds, we must first call [RioLRTCoordinator::requestWithdrawal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L99) which takes as input an `asset` and an amount of LRTTokens, `amountIn`.

The function transfers `amountIn` `LRTTokens` from the caller and calculates an amount of shares owed to the caller by first evaluating the `LRTTokens` in terms of `asset`, and then converting this amount into shares by querying the asset strategy on Eigenlayer:
```solidity
shares = IStrategy(strategy).underlyingToSharesView(amount);
```
This amount is then cached in the epoch `EpochWithdrawals` object for later use:
```solidity
EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(asset, currentEpoch);
epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed += SafeCast.toUint120(sharesOwed);
UserWithdrawalSummary storage userSummary = epochWithdrawals.users[withdrawer];
userSummary.sharesOwed += SafeCast.toUint120(sharesOwed);
```

As a second step, somebody must call [RioLRTCoordinator::rebalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L121) which takes as input an `asset`.
The function retrieves the total amount of shares owed to withdrawers in the current epoch for the given `asset`, via the `EpochWithdrawals` object. It then calculates the total amount of strategy shares held by the protocol by:
- Retrieving the total amount of `asset` held in the [deposit pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTDepositPool.sol) and converting it into shares by querying the asset strategy on Eigenlayer.
- Retrieving the amount of shares actually held.

The conversion rate of the strategy shares might be different between the two steps, the shares might have either increased or decreased in value.

This might cause inconsistencies and loss of funds.

### Example 1
Alice deposits `1e18` `cbETH` and then immediately calls [RioLRTCoordinator::requestWithdrawal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L99) to requests a withdraw of all her `LRTTokens`. While waiting for [RioLRTCoordinator::rebalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L121) to be called the value per share increases.

When [RioLRTCoordinator::rebalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L121) is called the protocol will calculate the amount of shares currently held, which can be lower than the amount of shares the protocol cached as being owed to Alice the moment [RioLRTCoordinator::requestWithdrawal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L99) was first called. The value per share increased, so the deposit pool is valued less shares.

#### POC
Add the imports to  `RioLRTCoordinator.t.sol`:
```solidity
import {IStrategy} from 'contracts/interfaces/eigenlayer/IStrategy.sol';
```

And copy-paste:
```solidity
function test_rebalanceFailsOnSharesValueIncrease() public {
    IStrategy cbETHStrategyEigenlayer = IStrategy(CBETH_STRATEGY);
    cbETH.approve(address(reLST.coordinator), 20e18);
    cbETH.approve(address(cbETHStrategyEigenlayer), 20e18);
    cbETH.approve(address(strategyManager), 20e18);

    //-> Assume the strategy on Eigenlayer has some deposits frpom third parties already
    reLST.token.approve(address(reLST.coordinator), type(uint256).max);
    strategyManager.depositIntoStrategy(address(cbETHStrategyEigenlayer), CBETH_ADDRESS, 1e18);

    //-> Deposit and request withdrawal
    reLST.coordinator.deposit(CBETH_ADDRESS, 1e18);
    reLST.coordinator.requestWithdrawal(CBETH_ADDRESS, reLST.token.balanceOf(address(this)));

    //-> Shares value increases by 1 wei
    cbETH.transfer(address(cbETHStrategyEigenlayer), 1);

    //-> Rebalance
    skip(reETH.coordinator.rebalanceDelay());
    vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
    reLST.coordinator.rebalance(CBETH_ADDRESS); //‚ùå REVERTS
}
```

## Impact
An increase in Eigenlayer strategies value can lead to unwanted reverts.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I'm not able to pinpoint a simple fix for this, but it arises from the fact that the deposit pool assets are evaluated in terms of strategy shares when the assets are not deposited in the strategy yet.
