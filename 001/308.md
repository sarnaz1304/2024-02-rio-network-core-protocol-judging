# depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer can be DoS.

## Summary
Due to rounding issues, anyone can DoS non-ETH assets allocation to operators by reverting the call to `RioLRTDepositPool.depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer()` at will.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance()` is called and there are enough funds to pay all withdrawals requests for the specified asset in the current epoch, the surplus assets are then allocated to operators to be deposited to Eigenlayer. 

During the deposit procedure for non-ETH assets, `RioLRTDepositPool.depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer()` initially converts the amount of assets to its equivalent value in shares (`convertToSharesFromAsset`), which rounds **down**. Later `OperatorOperations.depositTokenToOperators()` calls  `RioLRTOperatorRegistry.allocateStrategyShares()`, which computes the allocation to each operator and converts those shares amounts again to the equivalent value in the original asset, so it can be sent to operator delegators and then staked. However this second conversion (`sharesToUnderlyingView`) also rounds **down**.

As a result, if the first conversion rounds down, incorrect value of assets will be sent for each operator delegator for staking and consequently the final value of shares received will be less than expected and the code will revert. This can be exploited simply by frontrunning the call to `rebalance()` and depositing amounts as low as 1wei of that asset directly to that asset's Eigenlayer strategy contract, making the asset to shares conversion to round down, resulting in the consequences mentioned above.

Consider the following scenario: there is an Eigenlayer strategy for cbETH with `500e18`  cbETH in it. Currently there is `10e18` of cbETH stored in the deposit pool, thus `rebalance()` is called (for simplicity there is only one operator active). An attacker sees this transaction in the mempool and frontruns it by transfering 1wei of cbETH directly to Eigenlayer cbETH strategy contract. When `rebalance` transaction is executed, the following relevant values will be computed.

cbETH in deposit pool (amountToDeposit): `10000000000000000000` 
sharesAllocated: `9999999999999999999`
cbETH sent to the operator: `9999999999999999999`
sharesReceived: `9999999999999999998`

As can be seen, due to the rounding `sharesReceived != sharesAllocated`, thus the call will revert with `INCORRECT_NUMBER_OF_SHARES_RECEIVED()`. Below there is the POC for this exact same scenario (Apply this patch diff below and run `forge test --match-test test_POC`)

## Impact
Calls to `RioLRTDepositPool.depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer()` can be DoS, making impossible to allocate those funds to operators. Blocking the main functionality of the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider rounding up the result from `IStrategy(strategy).sharesToUnderlyingView(newShareAllocation)` in `RioLRTOperatorRegistry.allocateStrategyShares()` or loose the requirement to `sharesAllocated - sharesReceived <= 1` instead of `sharesReceived != sharesAllocated`.
