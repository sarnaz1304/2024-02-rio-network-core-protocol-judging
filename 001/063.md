# Division by zero in `convertFromUnitOfAccountToRestakingTokens()` can brick the deposit flow

## Summary
Deposits with none unit of account assets can cause an edge case that can brick the deposit flow. 

## Vulnerability Detail
On deployment a sacrificial deposit can be done with any valid asset. If the asset has low value compared to the unit of account then a small number of LRT tokens are issued.  A mininum deposit amount of 1000 units of an asset is required with the first deposit. If the deposit asset only has 1/1000 of the value of the unit of account then only 1 LRT token is issued because deposit amount is converted to the unit of account and then LRT tokens are issued. If the value of the deposit tokens drop after the initial deposit then the code on line 169 in the `RioLRTCoordinator` contract always fails because `tvl` can return zero. 

## Impact
Deposting funds to the `RioLRTCoordinator` permanently fails.  

## Code Snippet

```solidity 
    function convertFromAssetToRestakingTokens(address asset, uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 value = assetRegistry().convertToUnitOfAccountFromAsset(asset, amount);
        return convertFromUnitOfAccountToRestakingTokens(value);
    }

```solidity
    function convertFromUnitOfAccountToRestakingTokens(uint256 value) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 tvl = getTVL();
        uint256 supply = token.totalSupply();

        if (supply == 0) {
            return value;
        }
        return value * supply / tvl;
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The following steps should be considered

- Check that that the `tvl` is not zero before calculating the LRT amount. 
- The current approach of making sacrificial deposits has drawbacks compared to virtual shares and assets like in EIP4626 implementation in Open Zeppelin. (see further details https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/address-eip-4626-inflation-attacks-with-virtual-shares-and-assets/12677).
