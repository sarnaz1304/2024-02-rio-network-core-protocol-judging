# In `RioLRTCoordinator.requestWithdrawal()`, it doesn't validate the available shares properly when there are several unsettled epochs.


## Summary
As I've reported as a different issue - `currentEpochsByAsset is not updated in RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.queueCurrentEpochSettlement()`, there might be several unsettled epochs that have requested withdrawals from EigenLayer.

But it checks the current epoch only while checking `availableShares` and users might request to withdraw more funds than available.

## Vulnerability Detail

```javascript
    function requestWithdrawal(address asset, uint256 amountIn) external checkWithdrawal(asset, amountIn) returns (uint256 sharesOwed) {
        // Determine the amount of shares owed to the withdrawer using the current exchange rate.
        sharesOwed = convertToSharesFromRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn);

        // If requesting ETH, reduce the precision of the shares owed to the nearest Gwei,
        // which is the smallest unit of account supported by EigenLayer.
        if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) sharesOwed = sharesOwed.reducePrecisionToGwei();

        // Pull restaking tokens from the sender to the withdrawal queue.
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(withdrawalQueue()), amountIn);

        // Ensure there are enough shares to cover the withdrawal request, and queue the withdrawal.
        uint256 availableShares = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, assetRegistry().getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset));
        if (sharesOwed > availableShares - withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset)) { //@audit check all epochs
            revert INSUFFICIENT_SHARES_FOR_WITHDRAWAL();
        }
        withdrawalQueue().queueWithdrawal(msg.sender, asset, sharesOwed, amountIn);
    }
```

As we can see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L112), it deducts the shares of the current epoch wrongly.

So this might be possible to happen.

- At epoch 100, the total shares of `USDT` are 10000, and a user requested to withdraw the whole shares.
- So `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()` is called and the epoch is increased to 101. (According to my different report)
- Right after that, another user requests to withdraw 100 shares of `USDT` and it should be reverted because the whole shares will be used at epoch 100.
- But during the validation [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L112), `availableShares = 10000` and the new epoch(101)'s shares = 0. So it will be passed.
- But the new epoch wouldn't be settled as there are no available shares for `USDT` and the user won't get paid after depositing his LRT tokens.

## Impact
Users wouldn't receive funds after requesting a withdrawal as it checks the available shares wrongly.

## Recommendation
The shares of already queued epochs should be deducted also at [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L112).
