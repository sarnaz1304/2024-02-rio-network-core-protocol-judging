# RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol - If a withrawal is queued to EigenLayer it can then be settled normally, forcing the Deposit Pool to pay again for the sharesOwed, while some were already payed the first time

## Summary
 If a withrawal is queued to EigenLayer it can then be settled normally, forcing the Deposit Pool to pay again for the sharesOwed, while some were already payed the first time
 
## Vulnerability Detail
Withdrawals are processed through `_processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch`

```solidity
 function _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch(address asset, uint256 sharesOwed) internal {
        IRioLRTWithdrawalQueue withdrawalQueue_ = withdrawalQueue(); 
        (uint256 assetsSent, uint256 sharesSent) = depositPool().transferMaxAssetsForShares( 
            asset, 
            sharesOwed, 
            address(withdrawalQueue_) 
        );
        uint256 sharesRemaining = sharesOwed - sharesSent; 

        // Exit early if all pending withdrawals were paid from the deposit pool.
        if (sharesRemaining == 0) { 
            withdrawalQueue_.settleCurrentEpoch(asset, assetsSent, sharesSent); 
            return; 
        }

        address strategy = assetRegistry().getAssetStrategy(asset); 
        bytes32 aggregateRoot = OperatorOperations.queueWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(
            operatorRegistry(), 
            strategy, 
            sharesRemaining 
        );
        withdrawalQueue_.queueCurrentEpochSettlement(asset, assetsSent, sharesSent, aggregateRoot); 
    }
```

If the deposit pool has enough assets to pay the withdrawals, he will do so, but if there aren't enough assets, the rest of the assets will be queued from withdrawal through EigenLayer.

The assets are transferred here and they depend on `sharesOwed`
```solidity
(uint256 assetsSent, uint256 sharesSent) = depositPool().transferMaxAssetsForShares( 
            asset, 
            sharesOwed, 
            address(withdrawalQueue_) 
        );
```
`sharesOwed` are retrieved here
```solidity
 function rebalance(address asset) external checkRebalanceDelayMet(asset) { 
        if (!assetRegistry().isSupportedAsset(asset)) revert ASSET_NOT_SUPPORTED(asset);
        if (msg.sender != tx.origin) revert CALLER_MUST_BE_EOA(); 

        // Process any outstanding withdrawals using funds from the deposit pool and EigenLayer.
        uint256 sharesOwed = withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset); 
        if (sharesOwed > 0) { //ok
            _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch(asset, sharesOwed);
        }
```

They are retrieved based on the owed shares in the current epoch and are increased in `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#queueWithdrawal()` which is called inside `requestWithdrawal`


```solidity
function queueWithdrawal(address withdrawer, address asset, uint256 sharesOwed, uint256 amountIn)
        external
        onlyCoordinator 
    {
        if (sharesOwed == 0) revert NO_SHARES_OWED();
        uint256 currentEpoch = getCurrentEpoch(asset);

        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(asset, currentEpoch);
        epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed += SafeCast.toUint120(sharesOwed);
        epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement += amountIn;

        UserWithdrawalSummary storage userSummary = epochWithdrawals.users[withdrawer];
        userSummary.sharesOwed += SafeCast.toUint120(sharesOwed); 

        emit WithdrawalQueued(currentEpoch, asset, withdrawer, sharesOwed, amountIn); 
    }
```

```solidity
function requestWithdrawal(address asset, uint256 amountIn) external checkWithdrawal(asset, amountIn) returns (uint256 sharesOwed) {
        // Determine the amount of shares owed to the withdrawer using the current exchange rate.
        sharesOwed = convertToSharesFromRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn); 

        // If requesting ETH, reduce the precision of the shares owed to the nearest Gwei,
        // which is the smallest unit of account supported by EigenLayer.
        if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) sharesOwed = sharesOwed.reducePrecisionToGwei(); 

        // Pull restaking tokens from the sender to the withdrawal queue.
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(withdrawalQueue()), amountIn); 

        // Ensure there are enough shares to cover the withdrawal request, and queue the withdrawal.
        uint256 availableShares = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, assetRegistry().getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset)); 
        if (sharesOwed > availableShares - withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset)) { 
            revert INSUFFICIENT_SHARES_FOR_WITHDRAWAL(); 
        }
        withdrawalQueue().queueWithdrawal(msg.sender, asset, sharesOwed, amountIn)
    }
```

Knowing this, let's imagine the following scenario.

1. Request a withdrawal of 100. `sharesOwed = 100`  
2. `rebalance` is called and 50 is paid by the deposit pool the other 50 is queued to EigenLayer.
3. The deposit pool accumulates 200.
4. Another user requests a withdrawal of 100. `sharesOwed = 200` 
5. `rebalance` is called again and now the deposit pool has enough tokens to pay, so it will pay for 200 shares, while it should pay for only 100, since 50 were already paid and 50 were queued.
6. This results in a loss of funds for the protocol

## Impact
Loss of funds for the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Keep track of how many tokens were already paid/queued, so that this situation doesn't occur.
