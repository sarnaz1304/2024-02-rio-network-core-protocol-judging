# Missing slippage control when user deposit/withdraw

## Summary
Missing slippage control when user deposit/withdraw.

## Vulnerability Detail
When user deposits asset to mint LRT token by calling [deposit(...)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L77) functions, the mint amount is determined by the asset price.
```solidity
        amountOut = convertFromAssetToRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn);
```
User can not specify the min amount of LRT tokens he/she want to receive, if there is price fluctuation before user's deposit transaction gets executed, user may receive much less LRT tokens than expected.

Likewise, when user [withdraws](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L99), he/she may receive much less asset than expect.

## Impact
User may suffer a loss when deposit/withdraw.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `minAmount` and `deadline` to deposit/withdraw functions as slippage control parameters.
