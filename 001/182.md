# The function `settleEpochFromEigenLayer` does not update `currentEpochsByAsset`, resulting in subsequent settlement failed.

## Summary

The function `settleEpochFromEigenLayer` does not update `currentEpochsByAsset`, resulting in subsequent settlement failed.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `settleEpochFromEigenLayer`, protocol will handle the current settlement and set `epochWithdrawals.settled` to true, meaning it is complete. However, protocol forgot to update currentEpochsByAsset, which resulted in the next fetched `epochWithdrawals` being ones that had been settled previously. Therefore, the information of epochWithdrawals is not empty (like `aggregateRoot`, `settled`), which causes the function `queueCurrentEpochSettlement` to be reverted.

## POC

I modified the test function `test_claimWithdrawalsForEpochSomeEtherPaidFromEigenLayer` as shown below

```solidity
function test_claimWithdrawalsForEpochSomeEtherPaidFromEigenLayer() public {
    uint8 operatorId = addOperatorDelegator(reETH.operatorRegistry, address(reETH.rewardDistributor));
    address operatorDelegator = reETH.operatorRegistry.getOperatorDetails(operatorId).delegator;

    // Deposit ETH, rebalance, verify the validator withdrawal credentials, and deposit again.
    uint256 depositAmount = ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE - address(reETH.depositPool).balance;
    reETH.coordinator.depositETH{value: depositAmount}();

    vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
    reETH.coordinator.rebalance(ETH_ADDRESS);
    uint40[] memory validatorIndices = verifyCredentialsForValidators(reETH.operatorRegistry, 1, 1);
    reETH.coordinator.depositETH{value: ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE}();

    // Request a withdrawal and rebalance.
    uint256 withdrawalAmount = ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE + 1 ether;
    reETH.coordinator.requestWithdrawal(ETH_ADDRESS, withdrawalAmount);
    skip(reETH.coordinator.rebalanceDelay());

    vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
    reETH.coordinator.rebalance(ETH_ADDRESS);

    // Validate reETH total supply and process withdrawals.
    assertApproxEqAbs(reETH.token.totalSupply(), ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE, 100);
    verifyAndProcessWithdrawalsForValidatorIndexes(operatorDelegator, validatorIndices);

    // Settle the withdrawal epoch.
    uint256 withdrawalEpoch = reETH.withdrawalQueue.getCurrentEpoch(ETH_ADDRESS);
    IDelegationManager.Withdrawal[] memory withdrawals = new IDelegationManager.Withdrawal[](1);
    withdrawals[0] = IDelegationManager.Withdrawal({
        staker: operatorDelegator,
        delegatedTo: address(1),
        withdrawer: address(reETH.withdrawalQueue),
        nonce: 0,
        startBlock: 1,
        strategies: BEACON_CHAIN_STRATEGY.toArray(),
        shares: uint256(1 ether).toArray()
    });
    reETH.withdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer(ETH_ADDRESS, withdrawalEpoch, withdrawals, new uint256[](1));

    uint256 currentEpoch = reETH.withdrawalQueue.getCurrentEpoch(ETH_ADDRESS);
    IRioLRTWithdrawalQueue.EpochWithdrawalSummary memory currentEpochSummary =
        reETH.withdrawalQueue.getEpochWithdrawalSummary(ETH_ADDRESS, currentEpoch);
    assertEq(currentEpochSummary.aggregateRoot, 0, "aggregateRoot is not 0"); // @@audit: failed
    assertEq(currentEpoch, withdrawalEpoch+1, "currentEpoch is not updated"); // @@audit: failed
}
```

The execution result is shown in the figure:

## Impact

The protocol will be broken as settlement cannot be carried out.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update `currentEpochsByAsset`, as function `settleCurrentEpoch` does.
