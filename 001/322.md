# If a strategy is removed from whitelist in Eigenlayer, related asset gets stuck in the DepositPool

## Summary
If Eigenlayer's strategy whitelister removes a strategy for which there are deposits from users in Rio's deposit pool, the funds can get stuck in the pool, as they could not be staked in Eigenlayer (at least until the strategy is whitelisted again) nor withdrawn from the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever the `RioLRTDepositPool` contract wants to deposit some amount of an ERC20 asset to Eigenlayer, by calling function `stakeERC20` of contract `RioLRTOperatorDelegator`, this function calls Eigenlayer's `depositIntoStrategy` function of contract `StrategyManager`. This function will fail if the strategy is not whitelisted.

https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/6de01c6c16d6df44af15f0b06809dc160eac0ebf/src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol#L323-L328

The flow comes from a call to `rebalance` in the `RioLRTCoordinator` contract:

RioLRTCoordinator:**rebalance**
  |-> RioLRTDepositPool:**depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer**
    |-> lib OperatorOperations:**depositTokenToOperators**
      |-> RioLRTOperatorDelegator:**stakeERC20**
        |-> StrategyManager:**depositIntoStrategy**

The strategy associated with an asset in `RioLRTAssetRegistry` cannot be changed after the asset is added to Rio, meaning that if the whitelister in Eigenlayer removes an strategy from the whitelist for whatever reason, if there are deposits of that strategy's underlying in Rio's deposit pool, they will be locked until the strategy is whitelisted again.

## Impact
The impact is high as the issue implies funds could get locked an arbitrary amount of time.

## Code Snippet

The following test can be added to file `RioLRTCoordinator.t.sol`. It shows how the rebalance reverts if the strategy is removed from the whitelist.

```solidity
function test_rebalanceRevertsAfterRemovingStrategyFromWhitelist() public {

	// Ensure there is an operator to allocate to.
	addOperatorDelegators(reLST.operatorRegistry, address(reLST.rewardDistributor), 1);

	uint256 amount = 500e18;

	cbETH.approve(address(reLST.coordinator), amount);

	// We deposit amount to the deposit pool
	uint256 amountOut = reLST.coordinator.deposit(CBETH_ADDRESS, amount);

	// We assume here the strategy whitelister removes the cbETHStrategy 
	// from the whitelist
	IStrategy[] memory strategies = new IStrategy[](1);
	strategies[0] = cbETHStrategy;
	vm.prank(STRATEGY_WHITELISTER_ADDRESS);
	strategyManager.removeStrategiesFromDepositWhitelist(strategies);
	// 

	// Rebalance reverts. Funds deposited are stuck in the deposit pool
	vm.expectRevert("StrategyManager.onlyStrategiesWhitelistedForDeposit: strategy not whitelisted");
	vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
	reLST.coordinator.rebalance(CBETH_ADDRESS);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual review. Forge tests.


## Recommendation
Add a function in `RioLRTAssetRegistry` to update the strategy for a given asset:

```solidity
    function setAssetStrategy(address asset, address newStrategy) external onlyOwner {
        if (!isSupportedAsset(asset)) revert ASSET_NOT_SUPPORTED(asset);

        assetInfo[asset].strategy = newStrategy;

        emit AssetStrategySet(asset, newStrategy);
    }
```
