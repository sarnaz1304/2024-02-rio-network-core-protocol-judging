# Early depositors can manipulate exchange rate of reETH (LRT) to steal funds from later depositors

## Summary
Early depositors or the first staker can potentially manipulate the price of reETH through a donation attack, causing subsequent stakers to receive no reETH after depositing. The first staker can exploit this method to siphon funds from other users.

## Vulnerability Detail
When there is not any share supply, the amount of shares to be minted is equal to the assets provided. An attacker can abuse of this situation and profit of the rounding down operation when calculating the amount of shares if the supply is non-zero.

```solidity
function deposit(address asset, uint256 amountIn) external checkDeposit(asset, amountIn) returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        // Convert deposited asset amount to restaking tokens.
        amountOut = convertFromAssetToRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn);

        // Pull tokens from the sender to the deposit pool.
        IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(depositPool()), amountIn);

        // Mint restaking tokens to the caller.
        token.mint(msg.sender, amountOut);

        emit Deposited(msg.sender, asset, amountIn, amountOut);
    }
```
Total token minted is related to its totalSupply and the total value of all the deposited assets. This can lead to to the manipulation

```solidity
function convertFromUnitOfAccountToRestakingTokens(uint256 value) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 tvl = getTVL();
        uint256 supply = token.totalSupply();

        if (supply == 0) {
            return value;
        }
        return value * supply / tvl;
    }
```
As an example, an attacker can mint a single share, then donate 100000 USDC  Minting the first share established a 1:1 ratio but then donating 1000 USDC to depositPool() changed the ratio to 1:100000. Now any deposit lower than 100000 USDC will suffer from precision loss and the attacker share will benefit from it.

## Impact
Attacker can effectively steal funds from later users

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 It is recommended to pre-mint some reEth to dead address tokens to prevent manipulation.
