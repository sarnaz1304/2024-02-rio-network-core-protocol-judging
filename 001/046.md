# `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` will lock `queuedWithdrawals`

## Summary
if `epoch` of asset being settled by `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` is `currentEpochsByAsset` `queuedWithdrawals` will be locked forever.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue here is that if an epoch of an asset being settled by  `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` is the `currentEpochsByAsset`, the `currentEpochsByAsset` is never incremented BUT  epochWithdrawals.settled for that epoch is set to true. 

```solidity
 function settleEpochFromEigenLayer(//@audit-issue current epoch is never incremented.
        address asset,
        uint256 epoch,
        IDelegationManager.Withdrawal[] calldata queuedWithdrawals,
        uint256[] calldata middlewareTimesIndexes
    ) external {
        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(asset, epoch);
        if (epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed == 0) revert NO_SHARES_OWED_IN_EPOCH();
        if (epochWithdrawals.settled) revert EPOCH_ALREADY_SETTLED();
        if (epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot == bytes32(0)) revert WITHDRAWALS_NOT_QUEUED_FOR_EPOCH();

        uint256 queuedWithdrawalCount = queuedWithdrawals.length;
        if (queuedWithdrawalCount != middlewareTimesIndexes.length) revert INVALID_MIDDLEWARE_TIMES_INDEXES_LENGTH();

        epochWithdrawals.settled = true; //@audit epochWithdrawals.settled for current epoch is set to true.  but current epoch is never incremented.

```

So now RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.queueWithdrawal() will queue the new withdrawals in the same epoch for an asset that has been marked as settled.

```solidity
  function queueWithdrawal(address withdrawer, address asset, uint256 sharesOwed, uint256 amountIn)
        external
        onlyCoordinator
    {
        if (sharesOwed == 0) revert NO_SHARES_OWED();
        uint256 currentEpoch = getCurrentEpoch(asset);//@audit-issue this epoch may have already been settled by `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` 

        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(asset, currentEpoch);
        epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed += SafeCast.toUint120(sharesOwed);
        epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement += amountIn;

        UserWithdrawalSummary storage userSummary = epochWithdrawals.users[withdrawer];
        userSummary.sharesOwed += SafeCast.toUint120(sharesOwed);

        emit WithdrawalQueued(currentEpoch, asset, withdrawer, sharesOwed, amountIn);
    }
```

And it will never be possible to settle this newly queued withdrawals since the 2 settle functions check if `epochWithdrawals.settled` == true.
```solidity
  function settleCurrentEpoch(address asset, uint256 assetsReceived, uint256 shareValueOfAssetsReceived)
        external
        onlyCoordinator
    {
        uint256 currentEpoch = getCurrentEpoch(asset);

        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(asset, currentEpoch);
        if (epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed == 0) revert NO_SHARES_OWED_IN_EPOCH();
        if (epochWithdrawals.settled) revert EPOCH_ALREADY_SETTLED(); // @audit checks it here

```

```solidity
 function settleEpochFromEigenLayer(//@audit-issue current epoch is never incremented.
        address asset,
        uint256 epoch,
        IDelegationManager.Withdrawal[] calldata queuedWithdrawals,
        uint256[] calldata middlewareTimesIndexes
    ) external {
        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(asset, epoch);
        if (epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed == 0) revert NO_SHARES_OWED_IN_EPOCH();
        if (epochWithdrawals.settled) revert EPOCH_ALREADY_SETTLED(); //@audit checks it here
        if (epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot == bytes32(0)) revert WITHDRAWALS_NOT_QUEUED_FOR_EPOCH();

```
## Impact
if `epoch` of asset being settled by `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` is `currentEpochsByAsset` new `queuedWithdrawals` will be locked forever.

## Recommendation
In  `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` if epoch of asset to settle is the `currentEpochsByAsset`, do this :` currentEpochsByAsset[asset] += 1;`
