# Incorrect calculation of available shares lead to locked funds

## Summary

The calculation of `availableShares` used to assess if withdrawals are possible in a specific asset is incorrect. 

The calculation does not account for shares that are already queued for withdrawal in previous epochs. It is therefore possible to `requestWithdrawal()` even though not enough shares are available in the specified asset.
## Vulnerability Detail

In `requestWithdrawal()` `availableShares` is calculated

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L111

```solidity
uint256 availableShares = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, assetRegistry().getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset));
```

We can see that for both ETH withdrawals and for other strategies we do not account for shares are are currently queued

For non ETH strategies we include assets that are queued here

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol#L99

```solidity
uint256 tokensInEigenLayer = convertFromSharesToAsset(getAssetStrategy(asset), sharesHeld);
```

and for ETH we include it here

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorDelegator.sol#L122


```solidity
int256 aum = getEigenPodShares() + int256(getETHQueuedForWithdrawal()); 
```

Both of these parameters are update in `settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` and the `getTotalBalanceForAsset()` will therefore include currently queued assets.
## Impact

All calls to `requestWithdrawl()` for an asset that currently has at least one queued withdrawal risks getting stuck in `rebalance()` since not enough assets/shares are available.

A huge amount of assets can be stuck in rebalance since all calls to `requestWithdrawl()` will enter the same epoch.

Assets can be unlocked if deposit pool balance > `epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed` . If a large amount of assets were requested this might not be possible for users, observe that users can not use flashloans to unlock the funds since each user has to claim the reward individually.

## Tool used

Manual Review
## Recommendation

`getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset))` needs to account for assets that are currently queued.
