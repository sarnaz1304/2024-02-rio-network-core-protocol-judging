# Failure of user withdrawal may cause the rebalance function to get stuck.

## Summary
When the user calls the requestWithdrawal function, [it will check whether the protocol balance is sufficient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L111). However, due to incorrect updates of availableShares, the user may initiate a withdrawal request but cannot complete the withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail
Under normal circumstances, when a user requests to withdraw an asset, [the contract will check whether the corresponding asset in the contract is sufficient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L111).
```solidity
        // Ensure there are enough shares to cover the withdrawal request, and queue the withdrawal.
        uint256 availableShares = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, assetRegistry().getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset));
        if (sharesOwed > availableShares - withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset)) {
            revert INSUFFICIENT_SHARES_FOR_WITHDRAWAL();
        }
```
Among them, availableShares is [equal to the assets currently pledged in EL + the assets in the depositpool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol#L89C1-L102C6). The assets currently staked in EL are represented by assetInfo[asset].shares, and will be updated [when the assets are actually withdrawn from EL.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L238) This will cause problems.
Assume the following situation:
1. In epoch1, after user A initiates a request to withdraw asset X, all assets X owned by the protocol will be withdrawn from EL.
2. The protocol [has been rebalanced](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L121), but the protocol has not called the [settleEpochFromEigenLayer function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L216C14-L216C39), and assetInfo[asset].shares has not been updated.
3. At this time, epoch 2 has been reached, and user B initiates a request to withdraw asset X, which can be successful.
4. However, when rebalance is executed in epoch2, the rebalance function execution will fail because the protocol no longer has enough assets X to be taken out from EL.

## Impact
The user cannot withdraw assets after initiating a withdrawal request; the rebalance function may be stuck and cannot enter the next epoch.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        // Ensure there are enough shares to cover the withdrawal request, and queue the withdrawal.
        uint256 availableShares = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, assetRegistry().getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset));
        if (sharesOwed > availableShares - withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset)) {
            revert INSUFFICIENT_SHARES_FOR_WITHDRAWAL();
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add a variable sharesOwedTotal to separately record the number of withdrawal requests that have been sent but have not been completed.
```solidity
        if (sharesOwed > availableShares - withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset) - sharesOwedTotal ) {
            revert INSUFFICIENT_SHARES_FOR_WITHDRAWAL();
        }
```
