# Rebalance can break when strategy is no longer whitelisted

## Summary
Eigenlayer can remove a strategy from the deposit whitelist and block future deposits to it. When this happens, rebalancing can break when trying to deposit more assets into the blocked Eigenlayer strategy. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Rebalancing deposits any remaining assets in the Deposit Pool into Eigenlayer. 

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTDepositPool.sol#L47-L67
```solidity
function depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer(address asset) external onlyCoordinator returns (uint256, bool) {
    // ... snip ...

    address strategy = assetRegistry().getAssetStrategy(asset);
    uint256 sharesToAllocate = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, amountToDeposit);
    return (OperatorOperations.depositTokenToOperators(operatorRegistry(), asset, strategy, sharesToAllocate), isDepositCapped);
}
```

The LRT uses the Operator Delegator to interface with Eigenlayer and execute the deposit with `stakeERC20()`.

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorDelegator.sol#L178
```solidity
function stakeERC20(address strategy, address token_, uint256 amount) external onlyDepositPool returns (uint256 shares) {
    // ... snip ...
    shares = strategyManager.depositIntoStrategy(strategy, token_, amount);
}
```

Note that there are no prior checks on whether the strategy is still whitelisted for deposits. Any deposit attempts to the strategy after it has been removed from the whitelist will cause rebalance to always revert.

## Impact
This scenario can break rebalancing and prevent withdrawals when there are remaining assets in the Deposit Pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check in Operator Delegator's `stakeERC20()` that ensures that the strategy is still whitelisted before attempting to deposit into it. That way, even if the strategy is no longer whitelisted, rebalancing won't break.
