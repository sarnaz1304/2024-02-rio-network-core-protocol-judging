# Requesting a withdrawal while the current epoch is queued for settlement might revert

## Summary
Requesting a withdrawal via [RioLRTCoordinator::requestWithdrawal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L99) while the current epoch settlement is queued might revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function [RioLRTCoordinator::requestWithdrawal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L111-L112) makes sure there's enough shares in the protocol to satisfy the withdrawal request via the following code:
```solidity
uint256 availableShares = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, assetRegistry().getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset));
if (sharesOwed > availableShares - withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset)) {
    revert INSUFFICIENT_SHARES_FOR_WITHDRAWAL();
}
```

However, if the current epoch is queued for settlement, the calculation doesn't take into account the funds that are currently queued for withdrawal from Eigenlayer. The protocol will assume it has less shares than it actually does and the whole function might revert for underflow when the subtraction is executed:
```solidity
availableShares - withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset)
```

### POC
To copy-paste in `RioLRTCoordinator.r.sol`:
```solidity
function test_RebalanceUnderflow() public {
    addOperatorDelegators(reETH.operatorRegistry, address(reETH.rewardDistributor), 1);

    //-> Deposit `ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE - address(reETH.depositPool).balance`. The protocol has 32ETH.
    uint256 initialDepositAmount = ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE - address(reETH.depositPool).balance;
    reETH.coordinator.depositETH{value: initialDepositAmount}();

    //-> Rebalance the protocol
    vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
    reETH.coordinator.rebalance(ETH_ADDRESS);

    //-> Verify validator withdrawal credentials.
    verifyCredentialsForValidators(reETH.operatorRegistry, 1, 1);

    //-> Deposit again and request a withdrawal. Following this deposit, both EigenLayer and the deposit pool will have 32 ETH.
    //-> The protocol has 64ETH, 33ETH are requested for withdrawal.
    reETH.coordinator.depositETH{value: ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE}();
    reETH.coordinator.requestWithdrawal(ETH_ADDRESS, ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE + 1 ether);

    //-> Skip seconds to make `rebalance()` callable again
    skip(reETH.coordinator.rebalanceDelay());

    //-> Rebalance is called and the epoch is queued for settlement
    vm.prank(EOA, EOA); 
    reETH.coordinator.rebalance(ETH_ADDRESS);

    //-> Requesting a withdrawal for an 1 ETH, which should be possible, reverts.
    reETH.coordinator.requestWithdrawal(ETH_ADDRESS, 1 ether);
}
```
## Impact
Users can't temporarily withdraw LTR tokens even if they should be able to.

## Recommendation
In [RioLRTCoordinator::requestWithdrawal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L99) take into account the assets that are currently in hold for withdrawal from Eigenlayer in the calculations.
