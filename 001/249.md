# No Slippage Protection In The Deposit Functionality

## Summary

  A user might get way less LRT (restaking tokens) due to no slippage protection in the deposit function.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) A user deposits his asset in the deposit function https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L77
  
  2.) The amount of LRT tokens to mint are calculated as follows ->
  
  convertFromAssetToRestakingTokens -> convertToUnitOfAccountFromAsset -> getPrice(priceFeed) -> `_normalizeDecimals` -> convertFromUnitOfAccountToRestakingTokens
  
  3.) We can see from above the amount depends upon the price returned from the feed , therefore it is subject to slippage/MEV attacks
  due to which the user might get minted way less LRT tokens that intended.

## Impact

  Users might get way less LRT in return for their assets due to no slippage control.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

  Have a minAmountOut parameter in the deposit function , if amountOut is less than this parameter then revert.
