# The calculation of `availableShares` is incorrect

## Summary
The calculation of availableShares is incorrect.


## Vulnerability Detail
In the `RioLRTCoordinator.requestWithdrawal()` function, the protocol ensures that there are enough shares to cover the withdrawal request and queues the withdrawal. 
```solidity
        uint256 availableShares = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, assetRegistry().getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset));
        if (sharesOwed > availableShares - withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset)) {
            revert INSUFFICIENT_SHARES_FOR_WITHDRAWAL();
        }
        withdrawalQueue().queueWithdrawal(msg.sender, asset, sharesOwed, amountIn);
```

The calculation of `availableShares` follows these steps:
First, the total balance is obtained. 
Then, `IStrategy(strategy).underlyingToSharesView()` is called to convert the total balance into shares. 
```solidity
        uint256 availableShares = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, assetRegistry().getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset));
```

The total balance is calculated as follows: if the asset is not ETH,
 First, obtain the shares `sharesHeld` converted from the remaining assets in the rebalance .
```solidity
 uint256 sharesHeld = getAssetSharesHeld(asset);

```
 Next, `IERC20(asset).balanceOf()` is called to obtain the tokens of the asset existing in the deposit pool (tokensInRio). 
```solidity
uint256 tokensInRio = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(depositPool_);
```
Then, `tokensInRio` is converted into corresponding asset tokens in the EigenLayer (tokensInEigenLayer).
```solidity
     uint256 tokensInEigenLayer = convertFromSharesToAsset(getAssetStrategy(asset), sharesHeld);

```
 Afterward, the `totalbalance` is obtained by adding tokensInRio and tokensInEigenLayer.
```solidity
 return tokensInRio + tokensInEigenLayer;

```
The total balance is then converted into shares. 
```solidity
        uint256 availableShares = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, assetRegistry().getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset));


```

Assuming `sharesHeld` equals 3.99999 * 10^18 and `tokensInRio` equals 50000 * 10^18, and 1e18 shares to underlying is [1027083276412294460](https://etherscan.io/address/0x93c4b944D05dfe6df7645A86cd2206016c51564D#readProxyContract), the current protocol calculation process is as follows:
tokensInEigenLayer = 3.99999 * 10^18 * 1027083276412294460 / 10^18 = 4108322834816413718
totalbalance = 50000 * 10^18 + 4108322834816413718 = 50004108322834816413718
shares = 50004108322834816413718 * 1027083276412294460 / 10^18 = 51358383410292465687804


Since sharesHeld is already a calculated share, let's use another method to calculate: converting tokensInRio into shares and then adding sharesHeld. Total shares would be:
```solidity

total shares = 50000 * 10^18 * 1027083276412294460 / 10^18 + 3.99999 * 10^18 = 51358163810614723000000

```
It can be observed that the first calculation method yields a higher value, leading to inaccurate results.


## Impact
The calculation of `availableShares` yields an inflated result, leading to inaccurate accounting in the protocol.

## Recommendation
Convert the assets in the deposit pool into shares, then add the sharesHeld.
