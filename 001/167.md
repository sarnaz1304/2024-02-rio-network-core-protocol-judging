# RioLRTWithdrawalQueue::settleCurrentEpoch can be Blocked and prevent Epoch to increase for asset.

## Summary
RioLRTWithdrawalQueue::settleCurrentEpoch can be Blocked and prevent Epoch to increase for asset.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L216-L271

## Vulnerability Detail

1) currentEpochsByAsset is 0.
2) for example the current Epoch is 0  [_getEpochWithdrawals(asset, epoch)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L222)
3) RioLRTWithdrawalQueue::settleEpochFromEigenLayer is called and settle Epoch 0 [epochWithdrawals.settled = true](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L230)

NOTE: RioLRTWithdrawalQueue::settleEpochFromEigenLayer cannot settle a settled Epoch and it cannot settle Epoch 
that has not sharesOwed.

now Epoch 0 is settled so now every time [settleCurrentEpoch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L151-L169) is called
it will revert because Epoch 0 is settled. [if (epochWithdrawals.settled) revert EPOCH_ALREADY_SETTLED()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L159)
at this point epochWithdrawals is settled but [currentEpochsByAsset[asset]](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L166) not increased by 1.

## Impact
RioLRTWithdrawalQueue::settleCurrentEpoch can be Blocked and prevent increase by 1 so next Epoch will never come.
and it will stuck in Epoch 0.

## Code Snippet

POC: put this test in RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.t.sol

```solidity
    function test_SettaleEpochBlock() public {
        uint256 amount = 18e18;

        uint8 operatorId = addOperatorDelegator(reLST.operatorRegistry, address(reLST.rewardDistributor));
        address operatorDelegator = reLST.operatorRegistry.getOperatorDetails(operatorId).delegator;

        cbETH.approve(address(reLST.coordinator), type(uint256).max);
        uint256 restakingTokensInEL = reLST.coordinator.deposit(CBETH_ADDRESS, amount);

        vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
        reLST.coordinator.rebalance(CBETH_ADDRESS);
        uint256 restakingTokensInDP = reLST.coordinator.deposit(CBETH_ADDRESS, amount);

        reLST.coordinator.requestWithdrawal(CBETH_ADDRESS, restakingTokensInDP + restakingTokensInEL);
        skip(reLST.coordinator.rebalanceDelay());

        vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
        reLST.coordinator.rebalance(CBETH_ADDRESS);

        // Settle the withdrawal epoch.
        uint256 withdrawalEpoch = reLST.withdrawalQueue.getCurrentEpoch(CBETH_ADDRESS);
        IDelegationManager.Withdrawal[] memory withdrawals = new IDelegationManager.Withdrawal[](1);
        withdrawals[0] = IDelegationManager.Withdrawal({
            staker: operatorDelegator,
            delegatedTo: address(1),
            withdrawer: address(reLST.withdrawalQueue),
            nonce: 0,
            startBlock: 1,
            strategies: CBETH_STRATEGY.toArray(),
            shares: amount.toArray()
        });
        reLST.withdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer(CBETH_ADDRESS, withdrawalEpoch, withdrawals, new uint256[](1));

        // @notice withdrawalEpoch is 0. 
        require(withdrawalEpoch == 0);

        IRioLRTWithdrawalQueue.EpochWithdrawalSummary memory epochSummary =
            reLST.withdrawalQueue.getEpochWithdrawalSummary(CBETH_ADDRESS, withdrawalEpoch);

        // @audit now Epoch 0 is settled so now every time `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue::settleCurrentEpoch` is called
        // it will revert because of this line `if (epochWithdrawals.settled) revert EPOCH_ALREADY_SETTLED();`
        // at this point epochWithdrawals is settled but `currentEpochsByAsset[asset]` not increased to the next Epoch.
        require(epochSummary.settled == true, "IS_SETTLED...");

        reLST.withdrawalQueue.claimWithdrawalsForEpoch(
            IRioLRTWithdrawalQueue.ClaimRequest({asset: CBETH_ADDRESS, epoch: withdrawalEpoch})
        );
    }
```


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

when Epoch is settled be sure to increase [epochWithdrawalsByAsset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L30)
