# Epoch is not incremented when current epoch settlement is queued

## Summary
Epoch is not incremented when current epoch settlement is queued 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `queueCurrentEpochSettlement` function doesn't update the current epoch. Since the entire withdrawal process is epoch-based this breaks the entire withdrawal process.

For eg:
1. Newer withdrawal requests will be included to the same epoch, which if settled from eigenlayer will cause loss of funds for the user's since the amount of assets received will not cover this newly owed shares. This will also falsely decrease the amount of shares held by protocol.
2. If the epoch is settled from eigenlayer, all future withdrawals will fail since the same epoch cannot be settled twice.
3. If the epoch is settled using deposits, the withdrawal amount from eigenlayer will be lost since the same epoch cannot be settled twice.  

## Impact
Lost funds, bricked withdrawal process

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Increment the epoch. But when doing this, the owed shares of the epoch should be handled as else it will result in user's loosing their funds by queuing more than withdraw-able amounts
