# Epochs are incorrectly accounted for when queueing and settling them with EigenLayer leading to a DoS of the protocol's withdrawal functionalities

## Summary

Multiple issues exist with the way that epochs are accounted in the system which can lead to a complete/permanent DoS of the protocol's withdrawal functionalities, locking up all funds.

Rio uses assets (addresses) and epochs as a main accounting point of reference to categorize asset withdrawals, the problem arises whenever the deposit pool doesn't have enough assets to cover the pending withdrawals for the current epoch, that epoch is queued for a later settlement. 

## Vulnerability Detail

There are multiple ways in which a state of a complete Denial of Service will be reached where no withdrawals can be made whatsoever due to the way the accounting system for withdrawal queueing is set up.

Below is a scenarios/flow through which the denial of service state can be reached.

**Scenario:**

- Bob deposits 1 cbETH through the deposit function (Epoch 0).
- No withdrawals have been initiated in this epoch so the the rebalance function has been called and Bob's 1 cbETH is deposited to EigenLayer.
- Since no pending withdrawals were present in this epoch, `_processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch()`  was never called and the epoch number/counter was never increased.
```solidity
  // Process any outstanding withdrawals using funds from the deposit pool and EigenLayer.
        uint256 sharesOwed = withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset);
        if (sharesOwed > 0) {
            _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch(asset, sharesOwed);
        }
```
- Bob decides that he wants to request a withdrawal (Epoch 0).
- Rebalance function is called and since there is no funds in the deposit pool, `_processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch()` will queue this current Epoch for later settlement, once the withdrawal from EigenLayer arrives: 

```solidity
 address strategy = assetRegistry().getAssetStrategy(asset);
        bytes32 aggregateRoot = OperatorOperations.queueWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(
            operatorRegistry(),
            strategy,
            sharesRemaining
        );
        withdrawalQueue_.queueCurrentEpochSettlement(asset, assetsSent, sharesSent, aggregateRoot);
```
- There are multiple issues which arise from this, first we're still at epoch 0, since the only way that the epoch counter is increased is when the epoch is settled through the `settleCurrentEpoch()` function when the withdrawals are paid from the deposit pool, otherwise it remains the same.
- All following deposits made after the "epoch 0" was queued for settling will still be accounted towards "epoch 0", and the DoS will occur because:

- If any deposits were made after the epoch was queued for settling, all `rebalance()` calls will fail due to the "incorrect number of shares queued", before the epoch has been settled through the `settleEpochFromEigenLayer()`. EigenLayer withdrawals can take up to 7 days while it's planned that rebalance should be called every 24 hours.
- The bigger problem comes that even if the epoch has been settled, through the `settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` all following rebalance calls will fail indefinitely due to the epoch number never being increased, but at the same time  the `epochWithdrawals.settled` will be set at `TRUE`, leading to a permanent Denial of Service for the withdrawal functionality.

**PoC Case A:**

This PoC can be used as part of the RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.t.sol test suite:

```solidity
 function test_wwlCrashEigenLayer() public {
 uint8 operatorId = addOperatorDelegator(reLST.operatorRegistry, address(reLST.rewardDistributor));
        address operatorDelegator = reLST.operatorRegistry.getOperatorDetails(operatorId).delegator;

        uint256 amount = 8e18;

// Deposit cbETH and rebalance to move all tokens to EigenLayer.
        cbETH.approve(address(reLST.coordinator), type(uint256).max);
        uint256 restakingTokensOut = reLST.coordinator.deposit(CBETH_ADDRESS, amount);

        vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
        reLST.coordinator.rebalance(CBETH_ADDRESS);

        // Request a withdrawal for the tokens from EigenLayer and rebalance.
        reLST.coordinator.requestWithdrawal(CBETH_ADDRESS, restakingTokensOut);
        skip(reLST.coordinator.rebalanceDelay());

   vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
        reLST.coordinator.rebalance(CBETH_ADDRESS);

//After the epoch was queued with the above rebalance, another deposit is made.

 reLST.coordinator.deposit(CBETH_ADDRESS, 5e18);

//All following rebalance calls will fail:
    skip(reLST.coordinator.rebalanceDelay());

 vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
        vm.expectRevert();
        reLST.coordinator.rebalance(CBETH_ADDRESS);
}
```

**PoC Case B:**

```solidity
function test_wwlCrashEigenLayer() public {
 uint8 operatorId = addOperatorDelegator(reLST.operatorRegistry, address(reLST.rewardDistributor));
        address operatorDelegator = reLST.operatorRegistry.getOperatorDetails(operatorId).delegator;

        uint256 amount = 8e18;

// Deposit cbETH and rebalance to move all tokens to EigenLayer.
        cbETH.approve(address(reLST.coordinator), type(uint256).max);
        uint256 restakingTokensOut = reLST.coordinator.deposit(CBETH_ADDRESS, amount);

        vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
        reLST.coordinator.rebalance(CBETH_ADDRESS);

        // Request a withdrawal for the tokens from EigenLayer and rebalance.
        reLST.coordinator.requestWithdrawal(CBETH_ADDRESS, restakingTokensOut);
        skip(reLST.coordinator.rebalanceDelay());

   vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
        reLST.coordinator.rebalance(CBETH_ADDRESS);

 // Settle the withdrawal epoch.
        uint256 withdrawalEpoch = reLST.withdrawalQueue.getCurrentEpoch(CBETH_ADDRESS);
        IDelegationManager.Withdrawal[] memory withdrawals = new IDelegationManager.Withdrawal[](1);
        withdrawals[0] = IDelegationManager.Withdrawal({
            staker: operatorDelegator,
            delegatedTo: address(1),
            withdrawer: address(reLST.withdrawalQueue),
            nonce: 0,
            startBlock: 1,
            strategies: CBETH_STRATEGY.toArray(),
            shares: amount.toArray()
        });
        reLST.withdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer(CBETH_ADDRESS, withdrawalEpoch, withdrawals, new uint256[](1));

//After epoch was settled another deposit is made:

reLST.coordinator.deposit(CBETH_ADDRESS, 5e18);

//All following `rebalance()` calls will fail since the epoch number will stay the same but the epoch is settled, leading to a permanent DoS:

 vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
        vm.expectRevert();
        reLST.coordinator.rebalance(CBETH_ADDRESS);

}
```

## Impact

Permanent denial of service to the withdrawal functionality of the protocol if any of the epochs need to be settled via EigenLayer instead of the deposit pool.

## Recommendation

Increase the epoch counter/number when queueing the current epoch for later settlement.
