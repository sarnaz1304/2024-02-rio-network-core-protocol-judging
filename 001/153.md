# When excess assets are rebalanced, the protocol may fail to execute

## Summary
In the `depositTokenToOperators()` function, the shares obtained from `depositIntoStrategy()` and those obtained from `underlyingToSharesView()· are inconsistent. Additionally, there is precision loss in shares obtained from ·depositIntoStrategy()·, leading to a failure in the `if (sharesReceived != sharesAllocated)` validation.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance()` function, if there are remaining assets, the protocol calls `depositPool().depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer()` to stake them in the EigenLayer. 
```solidity

   // Deposit remaining assets into EigenLayer.
        (uint256 sharesReceived, bool isDepositCapped) = depositPool().depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer(asset);
        if (sharesOwed == 0 && sharesReceived == 0) {
            revert NO_REBALANCE_NEEDED();
        }

```

Within `depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer()`, if the asset is not ETH, the protocol calls `assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset()` to convert the assets into shares. 
```solidity
        address strategy = assetRegistry().getAssetStrategy(asset);
        uint256 sharesToAllocate = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, amountToDeposit);
        
```
The conversion process involves directly calling `IStrategy(strategy).underlyingToSharesView()` to obtain shares, where `underlyingToSharesView()` is defined as `(amountUnderlying * virtualTotalShares) / virtualTokenBalance`. 
```solidity
  function underlyingToSharesView(uint256 amountUnderlying) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
        // account for virtual shares and balance
        uint256 virtualTotalShares = totalShares + SHARES_OFFSET;
        uint256 virtualTokenBalance = _tokenBalance() + BALANCE_OFFSET;
        // calculate ratio based on virtual shares and balance, being careful to multiply before dividing
        return (amountUnderlying * virtualTotalShares) / virtualTokenBalance;
    }

```

Then, the protocol calls `OperatorOperations.depositTokenToOperators()` function, where it iteratively stakes the assets in the strategy and obtains shares.

```solidity
 for (uint256 i = 0; i < allocations.length; ++i) {
            IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyAllocation memory allocation = allocations[i];

            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(allocation.delegator, allocation.tokens);
            sharesReceived += IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(allocation.delegator).stakeERC20(strategy, token, allocation.tokens);
        }
        if (sharesReceived != sharesAllocated) revert INCORRECT_NUMBER_OF_SHARES_RECEIVED();

```

In the `strategyManager.depositIntoStrategy()` function, the protocol transfers the assets to the strategy pool and then calls `strategy.deposit()` to stake them and returns shares. 
https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol#L323-L342
```solidity
  function _depositIntoStrategy(
        address staker,
        IStrategy strategy,
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal onlyStrategiesWhitelistedForDeposit(strategy) returns (uint256 shares) {
        // transfer tokens from the sender to the strategy
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(strategy), amount);

        // deposit the assets into the specified strategy and get the equivalent amount of shares in that strategy
        shares = strategy.deposit(token, amount);

```

The calculation of shares in `depositIntoStrategy()` follows this process: the `strategyManager` first obtains `virtualShareAmount`, then gets `virtualTokenBalance = _tokenBalance() + BALANCE_OFFSET`. Note that `_tokenBalance()` represents the total sum of assets after transfer. Finally, shares are calculated as `(amount * virtualShareAmount) / virtualPriorTokenBalance`.
https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/strategies/StrategyBase.sol#L112-L116
```solidity
uint256 virtualShareAmount = priorTotalShares + SHARES_OFFSET;
        uint256 virtualTokenBalance = _tokenBalance() + BALANCE_OFFSET;
        // calculate the prior virtual balance to account for the tokens that were already transferred to this contract
        uint256 virtualPriorTokenBalance = virtualTokenBalance - amount;
        newShares = (amount * virtualShareAmount) / virtualPriorTokenBalance;

```
On one hand, there is precision loss in the shares obtained through `depositIntoStrategy()` when recharging in batches.
On the other hand,through this analysis, it is observed that shares calculated via `underlyingToSharesView()` are greater than those calculated via d`epositIntoStrategy()`. Consequently, the check will fail.
```solidity
       if (sharesReceived != sharesAllocated) revert INCORRECT_NUMBER_OF_SHARES_RECEIVED();

```

## Impact
When there are excess assets, the protocol may fail to rebalance
