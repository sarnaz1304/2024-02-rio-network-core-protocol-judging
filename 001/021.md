# No `minShares` slippage param when minting reETH leaves users with no control over minted shares amount

## Summary
No user defined slippage control when minting LRT.

## Vulnerability Detail
When users [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L77-L93) `ERC20` tokens to mint LRT, an oracle is used to determine the current price of the token. Since the amount of LRT received by the user is determined by an interaction with an oracle, the amount received can vary while the request is waiting to be executed.

The function that uses the oracle's pricefeed for the value of the tokens is the [following](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol#L188-L196):

```solidity
        address priceFeed = assetInfo[asset].priceFeed;
        uint256 price = getPrice(priceFeed);

        return _normalizeDecimals(price * amount / priceScale, assetInfo[asset].decimals, priceFeedDecimals);
```

Essentially, the user has no way to predict how many LRTs they will get back at the moment of minting, as the price could be updated while the request is in the mempool. `minAmountOut` or `minShares` checks are commonly implemented to allow for user defined slippage control.

## Impact
Users can be minted less amount of tokens than expected.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a `minShares` user defined parameter.
