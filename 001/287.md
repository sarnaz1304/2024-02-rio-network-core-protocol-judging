# `rebalance()` can still be called while awaiting EigenLayer withdrawal

## Summary

When a user wants to withdraw their asset, if there is not enough in the deposit pool, eigenlayer is called and user has to wait for the eigenlayer withdraw duration to withdraw their asset. While waiting, more users can withdraw their asset, and RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance will be called again to withdraw from EigenLayer, effectively resetting the cooldown.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user wants to withdraw their asset, the protocol checks whether the deposit pool has enough balance to facilitate the withdrawal. If the deposit pool does not have enough balance, EigenLayer is called and assets are withdrawn from EigenLayer. 

This withdrawal process takes place once a day through `rebalance()`. `rebalance()` can only be called once per day and it seems like anybody can call rebalance, so all withdrawals will be aggregated and processed together once a day. 

Looking through `rebalance()`, if there are any withdrawals pending, `_processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch()` will be called.

```solidity
    function rebalance(address asset) external checkRebalanceDelayMet(asset) {
        if (!assetRegistry().isSupportedAsset(asset)) revert ASSET_NOT_SUPPORTED(asset);
        if (msg.sender != tx.origin) revert CALLER_MUST_BE_EOA();


        // Process any outstanding withdrawals using funds from the deposit pool and EigenLayer.
        uint256 sharesOwed = withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset);
        if (sharesOwed > 0) {
>           _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch(asset, sharesOwed);
        }
        ...
```

If the deposit pool has not enough asset, assets in EigenLayer has to be withdrawn. `OperatorOperations.queueWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement()` (out of scope) and ` withdrawalQueue_.queueCurrentEpochSettlement()` will be called.

```solidity
    function _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch(address asset, uint256 sharesOwed) internal {
        IRioLRTWithdrawalQueue withdrawalQueue_ = withdrawalQueue();
        (uint256 assetsSent, uint256 sharesSent) = depositPool().transferMaxAssetsForShares(
            asset,
            sharesOwed,
            address(withdrawalQueue_)
        );
        uint256 sharesRemaining = sharesOwed - sharesSent;


        // Exit early if all pending withdrawals were paid from the deposit pool.
        if (sharesRemaining == 0) {
            withdrawalQueue_.settleCurrentEpoch(asset, assetsSent, sharesSent);
            return;
        }


        address strategy = assetRegistry().getAssetStrategy(asset);
>       bytes32 aggregateRoot = OperatorOperations.queueWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(
            operatorRegistry(),
            strategy,
            sharesRemaining
        );
>       withdrawalQueue_.queueCurrentEpochSettlement(asset, assetsSent, sharesSent, aggregateRoot);
    }
```

In `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()`,  tokens in the deposit pool is transferred to the withdrawal queue and the equivalent LRT tokens are burned. The user has to wait for all the assets to be transferred from EigenLayer to the Withdrawal Queue.

```solidity
    function queueCurrentEpochSettlement(
        ...
        uint256 restakingTokensToBurn;
        if (assetsReceived > 0) {
            epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived = SafeCast.toUint120(assetsReceived);
            epochWithdrawals.shareValueOfAssetsReceived = SafeCast.toUint120(shareValueOfAssetsReceived);


            restakingTokensToBurn = epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement.mulWad(
                shareValueOfAssetsReceived.divWad(epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed)
            );
            token.burn(restakingTokensToBurn);
```

The problem is that `rebalance()` can be called again after a day. If there are more withdrawals pending, then `_processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch()` will be called again. This will result in the cooldown time of EigenLayer constantly resetting because more people are withdrawing tokens. `settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` cannot be called because the `queuedWithdrawals()` array is always increasing.

```solidity
    function settleEpochFromEigenLayer(
        address asset,
        uint256 epoch,
        IDelegationManager.Withdrawal[] calldata queuedWithdrawals,
        uint256[] calldata middlewareTimesIndexes
    ) external {
        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(asset, epoch);
```

In the event that EigenLayer withdrawal cooldown is not reset, `settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` will also cause issues since it will make ` epochWithdrawals.settled = true`. Users who withdraw late can 'steal' other withdraws and bypass the 7 day time limit (invoke the withdraw process on day 6, and if EigenLayer withdrawal cooldown is not reset, call `claimWithdrawalsForEpoch()` first to get their asset tokens back). 

## Impact

Users cannot get their withdrawals back. If withdrawal cooldown is not reset, then users can bypass the 7 day withdrawal limit by frontrunning withdrawals since ` epochWithdrawals.settled = true`.

## Recommendation

If withdrawals from EigenLayer is invoked, rebalance() should not be called until `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` is completed.
