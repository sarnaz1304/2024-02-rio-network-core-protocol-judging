# Minting formula does not subtract pending withdrawals

## Summary
The minting formula in the coordinator does not take into account pending withdrawals when calculating minted shares.
## Vulnerability Detail
Deposits in the protocol are atomic, users [transfer in](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L82) tokens and are minted shares. Withdrawals on the other hand, are not atomic and are submitted as a [pending request](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L99-L116).

```solidity
    withdrawalQueue().queueWithdrawal(msg.sender, asset, sharesOwed, amountIn);
```

Due to this difference, an issue arises when users deposit their funds and are minted shares based on the [deposit pool balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L79).

Since withdrawal requests **cannot be cancelled** and sit in the deposit pool while waiting to be paid out, the deposit function will mint shares inaccurately based on funds that are queued for withdrawal, instead of `assetTVL - withdrawalRequests[]`. Once per 24h a rebalance can be attempted for that asset, and if the assets are paid out to all the requests, the share value will drop significantly.
## Impact
Wrong calculation when minting negatively impacts share valuation of depositing users and leads to value loss.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    withdrawalQueue().queueWithdrawal(msg.sender, asset, sharesOwed, amountIn);
```
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Calculate shares minted from `assetTVL - withdrawalRequests[]` since withdrawals cannot be cancelled and there's no risk of front/backrunning price manipulation and griefing attacks.
