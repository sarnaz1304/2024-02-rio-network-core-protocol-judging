# M-3 : Dos - Unbounded loop on supportedAssets

## Summary
SupportedAssets array can grow so large that it will end up consuming the maximum gas of any transaction that is supplied to it causing denial of service for services depending on it.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside RioLRTRegistery.sol , the function addAsset is used to push new asset information in supportedAssets array.
supportedAssets array is a dynamic array.

The function `_findIndex` iterates over the entire array in an unbounded manner to find the index of an item in supprtedAssets.
```solidity
  function _findAssetIndex(address asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 assetCount = supportedAssets.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < assetCount; ++i) {
            if (supportedAssets[i] == asset) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        revert ASSET_NOT_SUPPORTED(asset);
    }
```
The function is the core of isSupportedAsset and removeAsset among which isSupportedAsset is most commonly being used across multiple places in code.

The thing is when the size of assets keep growing ,the array will become large.
At one point , it will become so large that this will end up consuming entire transaction gas or worst to use entire block.gasLimit
Which will end every transaction function calling this method fail.

Currently there are 10 instances of calling isSupported Function in RioLRTAssetRegistry Contract and 2 instances RioLRTCoordinator

As the contract is UUPS upgradable, we'll witness more new core functionalities depending on this method .

```solidity
contract RioLRTAssetRegistry is IRioLRTAssetRegistry, OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable, RioLRTCore {

// remaining code

}
```
If this method fails, every function depending on it will too.



Likelihood: Low
Impact : High -  breaking core functionality of the protocol

-> Severity: Medium

## Impact
Breaking core assets support checks and newly added functionalities in upcoming upgrades of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For current implementation , add a MaxAsset Limit , and add a setter for this limit to be upgraded
