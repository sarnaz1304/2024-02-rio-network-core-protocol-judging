# Storage variables declared in abstract contracts (which are inherited by upgradeable contracts) without a reserved storage gap or name-spaced storage location

## Summary
Storage variables are declared in the following two abstract contracts:
1. The `RioLRTCore` contract declared storage variable `IRioLRT public token`
2. The `RioLRTOperatorRegistryStorageV1` contract declared storage variable `StorageV1 s`

These two abstract contracts were inherited by several contracts which are designed to be upgradeable, many of which also have their own storage variables. The said abstract contracts are not using a reserved storage gap or a name-spaced storage location for their declared storage variables, so that when a future upgrade happens and if new variables are introduced here, it will lead to storage collision and mess up with the proxy contracts' state.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `RioLRTCore` and `RioLRTOperatorRegistryStorageV1` are "father" contracts, and there are many "child" contracts, for example, `RioLRTAssetRegistry`, `RioLRTCoordinator`, `RioLRTRewardDistributor`, `RioLRTOperatorDelegator`...etc. The storage variables declared in the "father" contract will take storage slots prior to the variables later declared in the "child" contract. Meanwhile, all the contracts are designed to be upgradeable, so if a future upgrade meant to extend some functionality and added more storage variables in the "father" contract, then storage collision will happen to the proxy contracts of these "child" implementation contracts.

## Impact
Multiple contracts' states are at risk of being messed up by this issue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I have two recommendations:
1. Leave a reserved storage gap in those "father" abstract contracts, something like `_uint[30] _gap;` so that it leaves enough room for future upgradeability and new variables to be introduced

2. Follow the industry best practice for this situation and use name-spaced storage location in those "father" abstract contracts. The Openzeppelin upgradeable contracts are using this method, for example, please look at this one: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/fbdb824a735891908d5588b28e0da5852d7ed7ba/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol#L28
