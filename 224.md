# Redundant using Statement in Asset.sol Contract

## Summary
A  potential redundancy in the Asset.sol contract that could lead to reduced code clarity and potential confusion.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Asset.sol` contract imports itself using the using Asset for address; statement. This statement aims to grant direct access to functions and variables defined within the Asset contract using the dot notation `(e.g., recipient.transferETH(amount);)`. However, within the contract itself, the only function used from the Asset library is transferETH.

Furthermore, the contract already imports the Asset library directly, allowing access to its functions through the conventional dot notation `(e.g., Asset.transferETH(recipient, amount);)`. Both approaches achieve the same outcome, making the using statement redundant in this specific case.

The use of the using statement might create the impression that the contract is calling a function named `transferETH` defined directly on the address type. However, this is not the case. The function belongs to the Asset library and is accessed through the using statement, potentially leading to confusion for developers unfamiliar with the code structure.


## Impact
The unnecessary using statement adds complexity to the code, making it harder to understand and maintain.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to remove the using Asset for address; statement from the Asset.sol contract and replace  `  return recipient.transferETH(amount);` in the `transferTo()` function with return `Asset.transferETH(recipient, amount);`
