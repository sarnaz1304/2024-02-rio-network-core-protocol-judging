# Hardcoded gas

## Summary
Avoid hardcoding of gas allowance in ETH transfers, low level function calls etc 

## Vulnerability Detail
Gas sent for trasnferETH in Asset.sol is hardcoded

## Impact
Hardcoding gas can lead to functions reverting, sending of ETH failing, contracts failing to do any other mechanisms when receiving the ETH due to gas limit. Gas on Ethereum and OPCODES is always changing so there is no telling that a figure or 10_000 may still be ideal in the future 

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
function transferETH(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        (bool success,) = recipient.call{value: amount, gas: 10_000}('');
        if (!success) {
            revert ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED();
        }
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Never recommended to hardcode gas  rather ensure functions and processes affected and connected have sufficient reentrancy protection 
```
(bool success,) = recipient.call{value: amount}('');
