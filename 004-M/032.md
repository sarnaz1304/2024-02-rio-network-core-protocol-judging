# Risk of Insufficient Gas Allocation in Asset Contract

## Summary
The use of a fixed gas limit of 10,000 in the transferETH function can lead to unexpected failures in the execution of the function due to out-of-gas errors due to risk of Insufficient Gas Allocation in Asset Contract
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   function transferETH(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
>>>        (bool success,) = recipient.call{value: amount, gas: 10_000}('');
        if (!success) {
            revert ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED();
        }
    }
```
The function above shows how transferETH(...) function is implemented in the Asset.sol contract, the problem in the implementation of this function is related to the fixed use of 10,000 gas, If the recipient contractâ€™s fallback function requires more than 10,000 gas to execute, and since the function is also transferring Ether (which requires a base cost of 21,000 gas), the call will fail due to an out-of-gas error.
## Impact
The use of a fixed gas limit of 10,000 in the transferETH function can lead to unexpected failures in the execution of the function due to out-of-gas errors. This can result in failed transactions, leading to a poor user experience and potential loss of funds. Additionally, if the function is also transferring Ether, the gas required for this value transfer is not included in the 10,000 gas limit, which can also lead to out-of-gas errors.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of using a fixed gas limit, Protocol should consider a dynamic approach where the gas limit is adjusted based on the operation to be performed.
