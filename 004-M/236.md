# Out of gas on transferEth() prevents reward distribution

## Summary
The `Asset.sol#transferETH(address recipient, uint256 amount)` function `.call()`s the recipient with 10,000 gas ([link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/Asset.sol#L42)). If the recipient's `receive()` function performs actions that require more than 10,000 gas, the call will revert with an Out of Gas error.  One example is the receive functions in `RioLRTOperatorDelegator -> RioLRTRewardDistributor`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `RioLRTOperatorDelegator` receive function is designed to forward any excess ETH rewards from withdrawals to the reward distributor. However, the `receive()` function in the reward distributor performs computation in excess of the 10,000 gas supplied and the call will revert. 

`RioLRTOperatorDelegator` receive function:
```solidity
    /// @notice Forwards ETH rewards to the reward distributor. This includes partial
    /// withdrawals and any amount in excess of 32 ETH for full withdrawals.
    receive() external payable {
        address(rewardDistributor()).transferETH(msg.value);
    }
```

`RioLRTRewardDistributor` receive function:
```solidity
    receive() external payable {
        uint256 value = msg.value;

        uint256 treasuryShare = value * treasuryETHValidatorRewardShareBPS / MAX_BPS;
        uint256 operatorShare = value * operatorETHValidatorRewardShareBPS / MAX_BPS;
        uint256 poolShare = value - treasuryShare - operatorShare;

        if (treasuryShare > 0) treasury.transferETH(treasuryShare);
        if (operatorShare > 0) operatorRewardPool.transferETH(operatorShare);
        if (poolShare > 0) address(depositPool()).transferETH(poolShare);

        emit ETHValidatorRewardsDistributed(treasuryShare, operatorShare, poolShare);
    }
```

## Impact
Calls to `RioLRTOperatorDelegator#receive()` will revert and funds cannot be distributed.

## Code Snippet
This can be dropped into `RioLRTOperatorDelegator.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function test_EnoughGas() public {
        uint8 operatorId = addOperatorDelegator(reETH.operatorRegistry, address(reETH.rewardDistributor));
        address payable operatorDelegator = payable(reETH.operatorRegistry.getOperatorDetails(operatorId).delegator);
        // This will fail with an out of gas - visible in trace with -vvvv
        (bool s, bytes memory d) = operatorDelegator.call{value: 1 ether}('');
        require(!s, 'call succeeded when failure expected');
    }

```

## Recommendation
Modify this `transferETH()` to a regular `.call()`, as it's to a trusted address
