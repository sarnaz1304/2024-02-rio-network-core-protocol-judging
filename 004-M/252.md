# Fixed Amount of Gas Sent in Call May Be Insufficient

## Summary

Since the gas sent is hardcoded when sending ETH to the recipient  to 10000 ,  If the receiver is a contract this may be insufficient to process the receive() function. As a result the user would be unable to claim withdrawals from this function as a result withdrawals would be stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) User deposits his asset tokens (ETH in our case) into the RioLRTCoordinator.sol , let's assume the user is a smart contract.
  
  2.) This user requests a withdrawal for his LRT tokens , calls requestWithdrawal() in RioLRTCoordinator.sol
  
  3.) After the epoch is settled the user can claim the withdrawal using the claimWithdrawalsForEpoch() here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L92
  
  4.) This function would transfer the asset (ETH in our case) owed to us as follows 
  
  ```solidity
  request.asset.transferTo(withdrawer, amountOut);
  ```
  
  5.) The transferTo() triggers the transferETH in the Asset.sol , i.e.
  
  ```solidity
  function transferETH(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        (bool success,) = recipient.call{value: amount, gas: 10_000}('');
        if (!success) {
            revert ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED();
        }
    }
  ```
  
  As we can see the gas sent in the call is hardcoded to 10_000 , this can be dangerous since our receiver is a smart contract and this 
  amount of gas can be insufficient to execute the receive function in the receiver Smart contract.
  This will result in a revert due to insufficient gas and our receiver would never be able to claim his withdrawals. 

## Impact

claimWithdrawalsForEpoch() would revert since insufficient gas is being sent to the receiver address (a SC) to send ETH , therefore
our receiver would never be able to claim his withdrawals and as a result the withdrawals would be stuck in the conract forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

  Consider removing the gas field to use the default amount
