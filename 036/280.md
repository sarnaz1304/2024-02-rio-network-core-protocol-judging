# Adjacent validator exits cannot be reported due to incorrect checks

## Summary
Adjacent validator exits cannot be reported due to incorrect checks

## Vulnerability Detail
The `reportOutOfOrderValidatorExits` function internally calls `swapValidatorDetails` inorder to swap b/w the exited and non-exited validators

```solidity
    function reportOutOfOrderValidatorExits(uint8 operatorId, uint256 fromIndex, uint256 validatorCount) external {
        
        ....

        VALIDATOR_DETAILS_POSITION.swapValidatorDetails(operatorId, fromIndex, validators.exited, validatorCount);
```

To check for overlapping b/w the swapping indexes, the `swapValidatorDetails` function uses `>=` and `<=`. This disallows a valid scenario where the swap has to be performed with adjacent indexes.  

```solidity
    function swapValidatorDetails(
        bytes32 position,
        uint8 operatorId,
        uint256 startIndex1,
        uint256 startIndex2,
        uint256 keysCount
    ) internal {
        
        ....

        // @audit startIndex2 cannot be startIndex1 + 1 when keyCount >=1. Hence swapping between adjacent indexes is not possible 

        // Ensure no overlap in indexes
        if ((startIndex1 < startIndex2 && startIndex1 + keysCount >= startIndex2) || (startIndex2 < startIndex1 && startIndex2 + keysCount >= startIndex1)) {
            revert INDEXES_OVERLAP();
        }
```

Hence if the validator to be reported was `validators.exited + 1`, it would not be possible to report the exit.

## Impact
Some validator exits cannot be reported 

## Code Snippet
`>=` and `<=` is used

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `>` and `<` instead. The overlapping check could also be avoided completely since the swaps return correctly even in case overlaps
