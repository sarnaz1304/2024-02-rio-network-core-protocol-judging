# No Storage Gap is Set for Upgradeable Contracts

## Summary
RioLRTCore.sol contract is inherited by a bunch of other upgradeable contracts and no storage gap is set for the contract, which may result in with serious unintended results in a case of upgrade in the future.
## Vulnerability Detail
Storage gaps are a convention for reserving storage slots in a base contract, allowing future versions of that contract to use up those slots without affecting the storage layout of child contracts. Without storage gap, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract.

## Impact
This will cause misbehaviors within the codebase and break the upgradeability
## Proof of Concept
*RioLRTCore* is upgradeable contract and it is inherited by most of other contracts in the codebase. As an example, the *RioLRTCoordinator*  contract inherits *RioLRTCore*, and the *RioLRTCore* contract does not contain any storage gap. If in a future upgrade, some  variable are added to the *RioLRTCore* contract, these new variable(s) will overwrite the storage slot of variable in *RioLRTCoordinator* contract and all other child contracts that inherit *RioLRTCore* contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add a storage gap at the end of upgradeable contracts as given  below:
```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```
