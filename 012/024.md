# RioLRTCore::No storage gap implementation

## Summary
No storage gap was used by RioLRTCore.sol contract for future upgrade.
## Vulnerability Detail
The RioLRTCore.sol contract does not contain any storage gap. Many contracts in this system is inherited from RioLRTCore contract for ex- RioAssetRegistry, RioLRTAVSRegistry, RioLRTCoordinator, RioLRTDepositPool, RioLRTOperatorDelegator and few more. So if in future upgrade any storage variable is added in RioLRTCore contract it will overwrite the storage variable of any one of the inherited contract.
## Impact
