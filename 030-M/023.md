# OperatorRegistryV1Admin.sol::getOperatorUtilizationHeapForStrategy():Wrong accounting of heap.count

## Summary
In `getOperatorUtilizationHeapForStrategy()` `heap.count` is accounting incorrectly.
## Vulnerability Detail
Assume numActiveOperator = 4
Lets hardcode the [for loop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorRegistryV1Admin.sol#L337-L348) execution for numActiveOperator = 4.
i = 0 ->   heap.operators[i + 1] = heap.operators[1] = 1st operator
i = 1 ->   heap.operators[i + 1] = heap.operators[2] = 2nd operator
i = 2 ->   heap.operators[i + 1] = heap.operators[3] = 3rd operator
i = 3 ->   heap.operators[i + 1] = heap.operators[4] = 4th operator
Here i = 3 means `heap.count`/`self.count` will be 3 beacause:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorRegistryV1Admin.sol#L349
 ### Issue 1
we can't remove the last operator from heap. If we call the `OperatorUtilizationHeap::remove()` the call will be reverted because this function is called with the operator's index & with consideration of our example if we want to remove the 4th index the call will revert by INVALID_INDEX().
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorUtilizationHeap.sol#L95 We know our self.count is 3 so index > self.count.
### Issue 2
We can't update the utilization of last operator from heap. With consideration of our given example if we wanna update the utilization of 4th index's operator it will revert by INVALID_INDEX() because index > self.count.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorUtilizationHeap.sol#L117
### Issue 3
Wrong max will be returned from `OperatorUtilizationHeap::getMax()`. Assume heap.count == 1 which means with current logic of contract there are 2 operators in heap. Lets see the snippet from getMax().
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorUtilizationHeap.sol#L184-L187
Here the ROOT_INDEX i.e index 1's operator is considered as maximum operator but in reality the 2nd operator is maximum operator.

> - _N.B: The `heap.count` is correctly maintained by calling [`insert()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorUtilizationHeap.sol#L80), but this function was only used in [`allocateETHDeposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol#L397) [to reinsert operators](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol#L471) in heap which was [extracted from heap by calling `extractMin()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol#L433)._

## Recommendation
Change this line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorRegistryV1Admin.sol#L349 to `heap.count = i + 1`.
