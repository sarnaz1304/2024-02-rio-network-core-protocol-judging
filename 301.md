# Withdrawals close to maximum amount can revert

## Summary
Rebalance can revert when close to maximum available amount of shares is withdrawn as the balance in deposit pool may not cover its portion of owed shares

## Vulnerability Detail
Withdrawals are settled using funds from the depositPool and the earlier acquired shares in EigenLayer. To calculate how much shares is withdrawable, the depositPool token balance is converted to its corresponding share balance using the current exchange rate from EigenLayer. If the shares acquired from previous deposits were `x` and the deposit pool token balance corresponds to `y` shares using the current exchange rate, user's are allowed to request withdrawals for upto `x+y` shares. 
After the withdrawal request from the user, it can take upto rebalance delay ~24hrs amount of time to actually execute the withdrawal. In case the total requested withdrawal amount was close to the maximum amount of withdrawable assets and the exchange rate in EigenLayer changes (one share is worth more now. and hence the `y` amount of shares is now worth more the deposit pool token balance), the rebalance call will revert since the transfer of deposit pool token balance will not cover its associated portion of shares (unless further deposits are made) and there won't be enough shares to withdraw from EigenLayer.    


## Impact
Rebalance and hence withdrawals can revert when close to maximum available amount of shares is withdrawn

## Code Snippet
withdrawal requests consider the current exchange rate from eigenlayer to convert deposit pool balance

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since this will happen rarely it could be managed by monitoring for this case and making necessary deposits
