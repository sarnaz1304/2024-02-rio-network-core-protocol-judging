# Operators can increase/decrease there `OperatorStrategyShareCaps` by themselves

## Summary
Operators can increase/decrease there `OperatorStrategyShareCaps` by themselves using `OperatorRegistryV1Admin::setOperatorStrategyShareCaps()` as it lacks access control

## Vulnerability Detail
All operators have strategyShareCaps, which says how much shares of an asset of a strategy they can hold, and this can be updated using `RioLRTOperatorRegistry::setOperatorStrategyShareCaps()` only by owner but this function uses `OperatorRegistryV1Admin::setOperatorStrategyShareCaps()` under the hood to update the strategySharesCap, which lacks access control as only operatorRegistry should call this. Also a malicious operator can decrease other operators shares caps
```solidity
    function setOperatorStrategyShareCaps(
        RioLRTOperatorRegistryStorageV1.StorageV1 storage s,
        uint8 operatorId,
        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.StrategyShareCap[] calldata newStrategyShareCaps
   @> ) external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < newStrategyShareCaps.length; ++i) {
            s.setOperatorStrategyCap(operatorId, newStrategyShareCaps[i]);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
Operators can increase their caps to access/manage more assets, also malicious operators can decrease other operators shares cap
