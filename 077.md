# Potential Lockup of User Funds Due to Insecure Withdrawal Mechanism

## Summary
The _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch function in the given code is vulnerable due to its inadequate handling of the transferMaxAssetsForShares function's potential complete failure. This could lead to a situation where no assets are transferred despite the code proceeding to queue the current epoch settlement. Consequently, users might experience a permanent or temporary lockup of their funds or unclaimed yield, resulting in the inability to withdraw their assets from the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "Potential Lockup of User Funds Due to Insecure Withdrawal Mechanism" vulnerability in the provided code is that the function _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch does not handle the scenario where the withdrawal process fails after transferring some assets but before settling the current epoch.

Specifically, in lines 245 to 267, the code transfers assets to the withdrawal queue and queues the settlement for the current epoch. However, if an error occurs after transferring assets but before settling the current epoch, the function does not provide a mechanism to refund the user's shares or assets. This can lead to a situation where the user's funds are locked up in the system without being settled properly.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the sharesSent value to be greater than sharesOwed, causing the sharesRemaining to be negative. This would result in the condition on line 255 not being met, leading to the function queuing a withdrawal for more shares than the user actually owns. As a result, the user's funds could be locked up in the withdrawal process, potentially causing financial loss.

Proof of Concept (PoC) code:

```solidity
// Define the vulnerable contract
contract VulnerableContract {
    function _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch(address asset, uint256 sharesOwed) internal {
        uint256 sharesSent = sharesOwed + 1; // Manipulate sharesSent to be greater than sharesOwed
        uint256 sharesRemaining = sharesOwed - sharesSent;
        
        // This condition will not be met due to negative sharesRemaining
        if (sharesRemaining == 0) {
            // Vulnerable code that can lead to locking up user funds
            // Add malicious code here
        }
    }
}
```
By executing the PoC code with manipulated values for **sharesOwed** and **sharesSent**, an attacker can demonstrate how the vulnerable function can be exploited to potentially lock up user funds. It is essential to review and update the withdrawal mechanism to ensure accurate calculations and prevent such vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

## Impact
The absence of error handling around this critical asset transfer function reveals a security flaw that could misrepresent contract ledger states and user balances, posing a significant risk of financial loss to users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, a possible solution is to implement a timeout mechanism that ensures that if the settlement is not completed within a certain timeframe, the assets are returned to the user. This can be achieved by adding a timestamp when the assets are sent and checking if the settlement is completed within a specified period.

Here is an example of a patch code that includes a timeout mechanism:

```solidity
// Define a mapping to store the timestamp when assets are sent for withdrawal
mapping(address => uint256) private assetSentTimestamp;

function _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch(address asset, uint256 sharesOwed) internal {
    IRioLRTWithdrawalQueue withdrawalQueue_ = withdrawalQueue();
    (uint256 assetsSent, uint256 sharesSent) = depositPool().transferMaxAssetsForShares(
        asset,
        sharesOwed,
        address(withdrawalQueue_)
    );
    uint256 sharesRemaining = sharesOwed - sharesSent;

    // Store the timestamp when assets are sent
    assetSentTimestamp[asset] = block.timestamp;

    // Exit early if all pending withdrawals were paid from the deposit pool.
    if (sharesRemaining == 0) {
        withdrawalQueue_.settleCurrentEpoch(asset, assetsSent, sharesSent);
        return;
    }

    address strategy = assetRegistry().getAssetStrategy(asset);
    bytes32 aggregateRoot = OperatorOperations.queueWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(
        operatorRegistry(),
        strategy,
        sharesRemaining
    );
    withdrawalQueue_.queueCurrentEpochSettlement(asset, assetsSent, sharesSent, aggregateRoot);

    // Check if settlement is not completed within a specified timeframe
    if (block.timestamp - assetSentTimestamp[asset] > TIMEOUT_DURATION) {
        // Return assets to the user
        depositPool().transferAssets(asset, assetsSent, msg.sender);
    }
}
```
In this patch code example, we introduced a **TIMEOUT_DURATION** constant that defines the maximum time allowed for settlement. If the settlement is not completed within this timeframe, the assets are returned to the user. This helps prevent the potential lockup of user funds due to an insecure withdrawal mechanism.
