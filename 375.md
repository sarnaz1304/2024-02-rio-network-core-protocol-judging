# Donation Attack Possible in RioLRTDepositPool Contract

## Summary
The `RioLRTDepositPool` contract is designed for managing deposits into a staking system. It facilitates the deposit of assets, including ETH, and their subsequent management within a delegated staking framework. While the contract does not directly implement a lending pool or utilize utilization-based interest calculations, its financial operations necessitate rigorous security measures to prevent manipulation and ensure robust asset management.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Donation Attack Vector emerges from the contract's potential to receive unexpected token transfers directly, i.e., donations, which are not accounted for in the deposit management logic. This unexpected increase in contract balance through donations might interfere with the contract's operational logic, affecting its ability to accurately manage deposits, withdrawals, and asset allocations.

## Impact
An attacker could exploit this vector by "donating" tokens to the contract and subsequently manipulating state-dependent operations, potentially affecting the distribution of staking rewards or withdrawals.

```solidity
function depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer(address asset) external onlyCoordinator returns (uint256, bool) {
        uint256 amountToDeposit = asset.getSelfBalance();
        if (amountToDeposit == 0) return (0, false);

        bool isDepositCapped;
        if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) {
            // Due to the high cost associated with ETH deposits, we cap the deposit at or near the defined soft cap to avoid
            // hitting the block gas limit.
            if (amountToDeposit > ETH_DEPOSIT_SOFT_CAP) {
                // Only cap the deposit if the excess is beyond the allowed buffer limit.
                if (amountToDeposit - ETH_DEPOSIT_SOFT_CAP > ETH_DEPOSIT_BUFFER_LIMIT) {
                    (amountToDeposit, isDepositCapped) = (ETH_DEPOSIT_SOFT_CAP, true);
                }
            }
            return (OperatorOperations.depositETHToOperators(operatorRegistry(), amountToDeposit), isDepositCapped);
        }

        address strategy = assetRegistry().getAssetStrategy(asset);
        uint256 sharesToAllocate = assetRegistry().convertToSharesFromAsset(asset, amountToDeposit);
        return (OperatorOperations.depositTokenToOperators(operatorRegistry(), asset, strategy, sharesToAllocate), isDepositCapped);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement mechanisms to prevent or disregard unexpected token transfers that have not been conducted through the contract's defined deposit mechanisms.
