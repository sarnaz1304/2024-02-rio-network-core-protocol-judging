# Lack of chainlink oracle circuit breaker checks will result in incorrect prices

## Summary
The `ChainlinkPriceFeed.sol` contract lacks circuit breaker checks in case the value of an asset changes significantly (i.e., crashes), returning the incorrect price.

## Vulnerability Detail
In case the value of an asset drastically changes, chainlink aggregators have circuit breakers built-in `minAnswer/maxAnswer` , where if the price of the asset falls below `minAnswer`, the price returned will be `minAnswer`, and if it exceeds `maxAnswer`, that will be the price returned. This can create discrepancies where the oracle will return `minAnswer` if an asset crashes, when in reality, the actual price is below `minAnswer`.

It's important to implement checks to ensure that when this happens, the incorrect price is not returned. However, the `ChainlinkPriceFeed.sol` does not incorporate any checks. If such a scenario occurs, where the price of an asset crashes, the protocol will continue to return the incorrect value.

## Impact
Malicious actors can take advantage various ways, such as depositing worthless tokens for restaking tokens, since it will be valued by the oracle, hence the protocol, at `minAnswer`.

## Code Snippet
`ChainlinkPriceFeed::getPrice` [#L34-40](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkPriceFeed.sol#L34-L40)
```javascript
    function getPrice() external view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainlinkAggregatorV3(source).latestRoundData();
        if (block.timestamp > updatedAt + stalePriceDelay) revert STALE_PRICE();
        if (price <= 0) revert BAD_PRICE();

        return uint256(price);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Incorporate `minPrice/maxPrice` checks and revert when needed.
