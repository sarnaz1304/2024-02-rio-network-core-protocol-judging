# ChainlinkAdapterOracle will return the wrong price for asset if underlying aggregator hits minAnswer

## Summary
Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value  the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This would allow user to continue borrowing with the asset but at the wrong price. This is exactly what happened to [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
In the event that an asset crashes   the protocol can be manipulated to give out loans at an inflated price

should check the returned answer against the minPrice/maxPrice and revert if the answer is outside of the bounds:
