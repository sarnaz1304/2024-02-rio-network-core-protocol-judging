# Protocol is incompatible with wstETH

## Summary
Protocol will not be able to support wstETH, a popular token for staking, since chainlink does not have wstETH oracles on mainnet. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol mentions that `"We plan to support tokens with no less than 6 decimals and no more than 18 decimals."` Since wstETH (wrapped stETH) adheres to the ERC-20 standard and has 18 decimals, which is within the specified range, the protocol intends to support this token. In addition, the protocol mentions that the smart contracts will be deployed on `Ethereum Mainnet`.

However, `ChainlinkPriceFeed::getPrice` will fail for wstETH because chainlink does not have wstETH oracles on mainnet. Therefore the protocol will not be able to support this token. Many users prefer to use this token for staking, since wstETH holders continue to earn rewards even when their tokens are used in DeFi protocols.

## Impact
Protocol will not be compatible with wstETH since mainnet oracle will fail

## Code Snippet
`ChainlinkPriceFeed::getPrice` [#L34-40](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkPriceFeed.sol#L34-L40)
```javascript
    function getPrice() external view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainlinkAggregatorV3(source).latestRoundData();
        if (block.timestamp > updatedAt + stalePriceDelay) revert STALE_PRICE();
        if (price <= 0) revert BAD_PRICE();

        return uint256(price);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Leverage the stETH oracle's data to get the price for wstETH
