# The rebalance function could temporarily freeze due to stake deposit amount rounding down to zero

## Summary

The [rebalance(asset)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L132) method attempts to stake into EigenLayer tokens held by the DepositPool. When the asset to rebalance is an ERC20, keep in mind that operators' allocations are calculated as shares of the EigenLayer strategies, not as token amounts. In the edge case in which the newly allocated shares of an operator is close to zero, the calculation of the corresponding token amount could be rounded down to zero. EigenLayer's `strategyManager::depositIntoStrategy`, called from `RioLRTOperatorDelegator`, reverts when attempting a zero deposit, making it impossible to execute the asset's rebalance.

Depending on the scenario that triggered this state, unfreezing the rebalance function could require:
- Changing one or multiple operators `operatorShares.cap` configuration.
- Waiting for the DepositPool balance amount to change (withdrawals or deposits).

## Vulnerability Detail

When rebalance() is called for an ERC20 asset, outstanding balance in DepositPool is deposited into EigenLayer's strategy contract if possible. The execution path inside RIO protocol, zooming into the part of the code relevant to this vulnerability, looks something like this:

1. [RioLRTCoordinator::rebalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L121-L142)
2. [RioLRTDepositPool::depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTDepositPool.sol#L47-L67) --> [OperatorOperations::depositTokenToOperators()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorOperations.sol#L51-L68)
3. [RioLRTOperatorRegistry::allocateStrategyShares()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol#L342-L392)
4. For each new operator allocation: [RioLRTOperatorDelegator::stakeERC20()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorDelegator.sol#L174-L179)
5. For each new operator allocation: EigenLayer [StrategyManager::depositIntoStrategy](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol#L105-L111)

Let's dive into step 3.

The new token allocation for a given operator is [calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol#L362-L363) from the share allocation by calling the Strategy contract sharesToUnderlyingView function:

```solidity
    uint256 newShareAllocation = FixedPointMathLib.min(operatorShares.cap - operatorShares.allocation, remainingShares);
    uint256 newTokenAllocation = IStrategy(strategy).sharesToUnderlyingView(newShareAllocation);
```

The Strategy contract [returns a value](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/strategies/StrategyBase.sol#L200-L206) that might lose some precision. In particular, if `virtualTokenBalance` is smaller than `virtualTotalShares`, the amount of tokens will be rounded down:

```solidity
    function sharesToUnderlyingView(uint256 amountShares) public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
        // account for virtual shares and balance
        uint256 virtualTotalShares = totalShares + SHARES_OFFSET;
        uint256 virtualTokenBalance = _tokenBalance() + BALANCE_OFFSET;
        // calculate ratio based on virtual shares and balance, being careful to multiply before dividing
        return (virtualTokenBalance * amountShares) / virtualTotalShares;
    }
```

For instance, virtualTokenBalance=2000, virtualTotalShares=2001 and amountShares=1 will result in zero. This edge case gets unnoticed in:
1. [RioLRTOperatorRegistry::allocateStrategyShares](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol#L342-L392)
2. [OperatorOperations::depositTokenToOperators()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorOperations.sol#L62-L65)
3. [RioLRTOperatorDelegator::stakeERC20()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorDelegator.sol#L178)

And finally [reverts](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/strategies/StrategyBase.sol#L119) when [Strategy::deposit](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/strategies/StrategyBase.sol#L95-L124) is called from [StrategyManager::depositIntoStrategy](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol#L333).

```solidity
    // NOTE: `amount` here is zero
    newShares = (amount * virtualShareAmount) / virtualPriorTokenBalance; 

    // extra check for correctness / against edge case where share rate can be massively inflated as a 'griefing' sort of attack
    require(newShares != 0, "StrategyBase.deposit: newShares cannot be zero");
```

**Likelihood of occurrence**

Let's review step 3 again. The [new share allocation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol#L362-L363) for a given operator is given by either:
1. The remaining of shares for the given rebalance task, which is mainly a function of DepositPool balance and current operators allocation.
2. The difference between the operator's max possible allocation and its current allocation. This value is independent of the current state of other operators and the balance held in the DepositPool. 

So, whichever 1. or 2. is smallest is assigned as the new share allocation value:

```solidity
    uint256 newShareAllocation = FixedPointMathLib.min(operatorShares.cap - operatorShares.allocation, remainingShares);
    uint256 newTokenAllocation = IStrategy(strategy).sharesToUnderlyingView(newShareAllocation);
```

The likelihood of `newShareAllocation` being equal to 1 by chance seems very low. However, both 1. and 2. could be manipulated by depositing a certain amount of assets before rebalance() is called. Manipulating 1. doesn't seem very practical, because as soon as the balance of the DepositPool changes again, the attacker would have to deposit (or request a withdrawal) again and again. On the other hand, if rebalance() is executed so that an operator is left with `operatorShares.cap - operatorShares.allocation = 1`, this will freeze the rebalance function until the owner of the OperatorRegistry contract changes the value of `operatorShares.cap`.

What could motivate an attacker?
1. An operator could be fully allocated while preventing other operators from getting a greater allocation for a period of time.
2. Withdrawals could be delayed.
3. Deposits could be delayed.

**Same vulnerability for deallocation of shares**

An equivalent vulnerability can also happen when an asset gets deallocated, i.e. when withdrawals from the DepositPool are attempted while rebalancing, which will revert at [StrategyManager::removeShares](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol#L358) if the shares amount got rounded down to zero.

## Impact

The rebalance of an asset could be delayed or frozen until the operator registry owner changes operators configurations. One way of exploiting this is making sure there's a specific amount of tokens in the DepositPool when rebalance() is called, for example by front-running it with a deposit operation. Although this could also happen accidentally, it's highly unlikely.

## Recommendation

Skip the allocation/deallocation of new shares for operators when the token/shares amount equals zero.
