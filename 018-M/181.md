# Deposit pool balance can’t be deposited to eigenlayer in a case.

## Summary
Deposit pool balance can’t be deposited to eigenlayer if any user doesn't withdraw for a long time which will cause shareowed = 0 for a long time.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let assume for an asset, total shareowed = 0k for withdrawals and total address pool balance = 8k in the current epoch.
2. The rebalance function is called,  as  sharesOwed = 0, rebalance will revert.

## Impact
Those deposit pool asset’s balance will be unutilized and can’t earn any rewards.
