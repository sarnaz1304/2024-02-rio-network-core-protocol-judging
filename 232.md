# Missing safe approval in initial deposit could cause a denial of service for USDT-like tokens

## Summary

When a new LRT is created, the RioLRTIssuer executes an initial deposit to prevent against inflation attacks. This initial deposit is executed without the SafeERC20 wrapper, leading to a denial of service for USDT-like tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_deposit()` function in the RioLRTIssuer contracts executes an initial deposit to prevent against inflation attacks. To do so, it pulls the funds from the caller and grants an approval to the coordinator contract.

```solidity
function _deposit(IRioLRTCoordinator coordinator, address asset, uint256 amount) internal {
    if (amount < MIN_SACRIFICIAL_DEPOSIT) revert INSUFFICIENT_SACRIFICIAL_DEPOSIT();
    if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) {
        if (amount != msg.value) revert INVALID_ETH_PROVIDED();
        coordinator.depositETH{value: amount}();
        return;
    }

    IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    IERC20(asset).approve(address(coordinator), amount);

    coordinator.deposit(asset, amount);
}
```

The approval is executed using the standard ERC20 interface, and not the SafeERC20 `safeApprove()` version. This operation will revert for USDT-like tokens that don't return a boolean result, leading to a denial of service.

## Impact

LRT cannot be deployed when the underlying asset is not compatible with the ERC20 standard, due to an unexpected revert when executing the ERC20 approval for the initial deposit.

The issue should be under scope as the FAQ for the contest explicitly states the support for non-standard tokens.

## Recommendation

Use the SafeERC20 wrapper and replace `approve()` for `safeApprove()`.
