# Rebalances are DoS'd during withdrawal delay

## Summary

queueCurrentEpochSettlement is called for every rebalance with insufficient funds to cover withdrawals in the current epoch. However, since this function can only be called once per epoch, during the withdrawal delay, rebalance is DoS'd.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a withdrawal settlement is queued with queueCurrentEpochSettlement, the epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot is set as the provided aggregateRoot parameter:

```solidity
epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot = aggregateRoot;
```

This function is called during the rebalance process if there is insufficient funds in the deposit pool to settle withdrawals from the current epoch. Rebalance is expected to be called daily, but if there remains insufficient funds in the deposit pool to settle, we will call queueCurrentEpochSettlement again. However, since epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot has already been set, execution will revert:

```solidity
if (epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot != bytes32(0)) revert WITHDRAWALS_ALREADY_QUEUED_FOR_EPOCH();
```

For each queued settlement, EigenLayer enforces a 7 day withdrawal delay. During that period, as long as there are insufficient funds in the deposit pool, rebalancing will be DoS'd.

## Impact

Rebalancing is DoS'd during withdrawal periods.

## Recommendation

If a settlement is ongoing, allow rebalance to proceed attempting to re-queue the settlement.
