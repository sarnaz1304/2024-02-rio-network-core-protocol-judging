# Queued withdrawals after queued settlement result in claims only being partially paid out

## Summary

It's possible to queue withdrawals while a settlement is queued, while the amount received from the settlement remains the amount at the time of queueing the settlement. This causes withdrawals to be underpaid.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a settlement is queued by queueCurrentEpochSettlement, there is no change to the state that prevents additional withdrawals from being queued in the same epoch. In the case that additional withdrawals are queued following queueCurrentEpochSettlement but prior to the epoch being settled, which is up to a 7 day period, only the original amount of assets is withdrawn, causing all withdrawals to be proportionally underpaid.

## Impact

WIthdrawals can be significantly underpaid.
