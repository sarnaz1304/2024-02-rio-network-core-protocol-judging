# When the epoch is rebalanced multiple times, users will experience a loss of funds when claiming

## Summary
In the `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()` function, `epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived` is directly overwritten with the new value. If the current epoch is rebalanced multiple times, resulting in a decrease in the `assetsReceived` value, the amount received by users when claiming will be reduced.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance()` function serves to rebalance the provided asset by handling outstanding withdrawals and depositing remaining assets into EigenLayer. Within this function, if `sharesOwed` is greater than zero, the protocol calls the `_processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch()` function. 
```solidity
    function rebalance(address asset) external checkRebalanceDelayMet(asset) {
        if (!assetRegistry().isSupportedAsset(asset)) revert ASSET_NOT_SUPPORTED(asset);
        if (msg.sender != tx.origin) revert CALLER_MUST_BE_EOA();

        // Process any outstanding withdrawals using funds from the deposit pool and EigenLayer.
        uint256 sharesOwed = withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset);
        if (sharesOwed > 0) {
            _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch(asset, sharesOwed);
        }

```

This function processes user withdrawals for the provided asset by transferring available assets from the deposit pool and queuing any remaining amount for withdrawal from EigenLayer.
```solidity

        address strategy = assetRegistry().getAssetStrategy(asset);
        bytes32 aggregateRoot = OperatorOperations.queueWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(
            operatorRegistry(),
            strategy,
            sharesRemaining
        );
        withdrawalQueue_.queueCurrentEpochSettlement(asset, assetsSent, sharesSent, aggregateRoot);
    
```

During the `queueCurrentEpochSettlement()` function, the protocol records values such as `epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived`, `epochWithdrawals.shareValueOfAssetsReceived`, and `epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement`. 

```solidity

 uint256 restakingTokensToBurn;
        if (assetsReceived > 0) {
            epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived = SafeCast.toUint120(assetsReceived);
            epochWithdrawals.shareValueOfAssetsReceived = SafeCast.toUint120(shareValueOfAssetsReceived);

            restakingTokensToBurn = epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement.mulWad(
                shareValueOfAssetsReceived.divWad(epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed)
            );
            token.burn(restakingTokensToBurn);

            epochWithdrawals.amountToBurnAtSettlement -= restakingTokensToBurn;
        }
        epochWithdrawals.aggregateRoot = aggregateRoot;

```
The protocol sets the rebalance delay to 24 hours during initialization. If settleEpochFromEigenLayer() is not called by any user within 24 hours, then rebalance() can be executed again.
```solidity
    function initialize(address initialOwner, address token_) external initializer {
        __Ownable_init(initialOwner);
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        __RioLRTCore_init(token_);

        _setRebalanceDelay(24 hours);
    }

```
 if `rebalance()` is called multiple times within the current epoch, each time these values will be overwritten by the latest values.

Subsequently, when settlement occurs and users claim their assets, the protocol calculates the amount based on `epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived`. Due to the overwritten values, this may result in a decrease in the amount received by users during the claim process, leading to financial losses for users.
```solidity
  function claimWithdrawalsForEpoch(ClaimRequest calldata request) public returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        address withdrawer = msg.sender;

        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(request.asset, request.epoch);
        if (!epochWithdrawals.settled) revert EPOCH_NOT_SETTLED();

        UserWithdrawalSummary memory userSummary = epochWithdrawals.users[withdrawer];
        if (userSummary.sharesOwed == 0) revert NO_SHARES_OWED_IN_EPOCH();
        if (userSummary.claimed) revert WITHDRAWAL_ALREADY_CLAIMED();

        epochWithdrawals.users[withdrawer].claimed = true;

        amountOut = userSummary.sharesOwed.mulDiv(epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived, epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed);
        request.asset.transferTo(withdrawer, amountOut);


```

Similarly, the `sharesOwed` calculation in `RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance()` is incorrect, and the calculation in `requestWithdrawal()` where `sharesOwed > availableShares - withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset) `is also incorrect.

## Impact
Rebalancing the epoch multiple times can result in a decrease in assets when users claim them

## Recommendation
`epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived` adopts an accumulation approach.
