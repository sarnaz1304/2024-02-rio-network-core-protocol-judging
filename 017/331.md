# Malicious operator can steal stakers ETH by setting a validator withdrawal credentials to an address he controls

## Summary
Malicious operator can steal stakers ETH by setting a validator withdrawal credentials to an address he controls.

## Vulnerability Detail
Validators are added by an operator manager by calling [RioLRTOperatorRegistry::addValidatorDetails()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol#L261). Once added they can be deposited into by the protocol after a delay of `validatorKeyReviewPeriod`, currently set to 1 day.

Validators are not required to have the correct withdrawal credentials before a deposit can be made. It's possible for an operator to:
1. Add a validator details
2. Wait 1 day
3. Wait for his validator to get deposited into
4. Set the withdrawal credentials of the validator to a controlled address instead of the correct EIgenpod
5. Exit the validator and steal staker funds

## Impact
Malicious operator can steal stakers ETH.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The security daemon should ensure the validators have the withdrawal credentials already pointed to the correct Eigenpod when added via [RioLRTOperatorRegistry::addValidatorDetails()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol#L261).
