# Permanent DoS of `removeAsset` via one-time 1 gwei deposit

## Summary


## Vulnerability Detail

In case an underlying token becomes unreliable, RioLRTAssetRegistry allows the owner (RioDAO) to remove it from the set of underlying assets, so the LRT will not have to be completely redeployed every time any of its underlying tokens needs to be removed. 

By design, the asset can only be removed if the TVL for that asset is zero (balance in EigenLayer + balance in depositPool). While it does guarantee that every genuine user will be able to redeem their underlying token before it becomes unsupported, it opens an attack path that would prevent the token from ever being removed: by depositing just 1 gwei of an underlying token (or withdrawing 1 gwei less than the whole amount), any user would forever (until withdrawn) prevent the removal of that token. 

## Impact
An asset can not be removed as long as at least one depositor leaves 1 gwei in the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
    function removeAsset(address asset) external onlyOwner {
        if (!isSupportedAsset(asset)) revert ASSET_NOT_SUPPORTED(asset);
-       if (getTVLForAsset(asset) > 0) revert ASSET_HAS_BALANCE();
```
