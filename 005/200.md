# Attacker can prevent asset from being deleted by sending 1 wei

## Summary
Attacker can prevent asset from being deleted by sending 1 wei.

## Vulnerability Detail
Asset Registry only can remove an underlying asset from the liquid restaking token by calling [removeAsset(...)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol#L250) function.

This function will check TVL for the asset, and revert if asset has balance.
```solidity
        if (getTVLForAsset(asset) > 0) revert ASSET_HAS_BALANCE();
```
The asset balance if composed of 2 parts, the balance in deposit pool and the balance in EigenLayer:
```solidity
        uint256 tokensInRio = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(depositPool_);
        uint256 tokensInEigenLayer = convertFromSharesToAsset(getAssetStrategy(asset), sharesHeld);
```

An attacker can simply sent 1 wei to deposit pool, and owner's transaction to remove the asset will revert.

## Impact
An asset is likely to be removed when assets usage or quality is decreasing, such assets usually have low liquidity and the price can be easily manipulated.

## Recommendation
Skip checking asset balance when removing the asset.
