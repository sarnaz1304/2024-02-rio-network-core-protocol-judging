# Some operatorids may be less utilized unfairly for a strategy.

## Summary
Some operatorids may be less utilized unfairly for a strategy.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let assume, for an asset , depositcap = 200k and the asset’s strategy has 3 operatorids.every operatorid’s cap = 100k. Currently 1st operatorindex allocation = 10k, 2nd operatorindex allocation = 15k, 3rd operatorindex allocation = 20k.
2. Now 20k asset’s amount are deposited which are allocated to 1st operatorindex and   OperatorUtilizationHeap’s updateUtilization function is called with index 1 parameter which calls function ._bubbleDown.
3. See ._bubbleDown function, as _isOnMinLevel(1) = true, so _bubbleDownMin function is called.
4. See function _bubbleDownMin where self._hasChildren(1) = true.  m = operatorindex 3. After that operator index 1 swaps with operator index 3 because operator index 3 is less utilized than operator index 1.
5. See function  _getExtremeChildIndexOrGrandchild(this only works when function _getSmallestChildIndexOrGrandchild is called) where parentindex(1) is  always swapped with rightchild(3) if it’s utilization is less than parentindex.but parentindex(1) is not swapped always with leftchild if it’s utilization is less. Parentindex is only swapped with leftchild when rightchild’s utilization is greater than parentindex.  
6. If parentindex’s(1) utilization always remains greater than rightchild’s utilization, then operatorindex1 will allocate = 92.5k, operatorindex3 will allocate = 92.5k , operatorindex2 will allocate only 15k.  

## Impact
Some operatorids may be less utilized unfairly for a strategy.
