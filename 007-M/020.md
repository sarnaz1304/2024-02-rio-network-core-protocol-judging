# `removeAsset()` can be indefinitely DOS'd by donating 1 wei of token to deposit pool which prevents asset strategies from being changed

## Summary
Changing of an underlying asset's Eigen Layer strategy can be prevented by griefing.

## Vulnerability Details
A malicious user can prevent an admin that is attempting to [remove an asset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol#L250-L263) in the asset registry contract since the function first checks if there's any remaining TVL in the deposit pool:

```solidity
        if (getTVLForAsset(asset) > 0) revert ASSET_HAS_BALANCE();
```

By [getting the TVL](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol#L79-L85) for an `ERC20` asset, one of the variables of the total balance is `tokensInRio` which corresponds to the `IERC20(asset).balanceOf(depositPool_)`.

```solidity
function getTotalBalanceForAsset(address asset) public view returns (uint256) {
        if (!isSupportedAsset(asset)) revert ASSET_NOT_SUPPORTED(asset);

        address depositPool_ = address(depositPool());
        if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) {
            return depositPool_.balance + getETHBalanceInEigenLayer();
        }

        uint256 sharesHeld = getAssetSharesHeld(asset);
@>      uint256 tokensInRio = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(depositPool_);
        uint256 tokensInEigenLayer = convertFromSharesToAsset(getAssetStrategy(asset), sharesHeld);

        return tokensInRio + tokensInEigenLayer;
    }
```

Any user can keep front-running the removal and prevent it by donating 1 wei of tokens to the address of the deposit pool. Initially I thought this is not that big of an issue, but I subsequently found out that there is no implemented functionality to change the Eigen Layer strategy for an asset. Currently, the only way to change the strategy is to remove the asset and then re-add it with the new strategy address pointer.

Just re-adding the asset again with another strategy pointer would [also not work due to this check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol#L327).

As long as a user user keeps front-running the admin and donating 1 wei by direct transfer to the deposit pool address, the admin will never be able to change the strategy of an LRT's underlying asset. Therefore, I believe Medium severity is warranted.

## Impact
DOS of core functionality - changing the Eigen Layer strategy for an LRT's underlying asset.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the TVL check and redistribute the assets after the removal per admin's discretion.
