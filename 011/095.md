# Attacker can block deposits to Eigenlayer and prevent yields

## Summary
Anyone can fully withdraw ETH from an operator in Eigenlayer. This exits validators and once validators are exited, they can no longer be allocated ETH to. This is what enables anyone to prevent the protocol from gaining yields.

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can fully withdraw ETH from an Eigepod via scraping in the Operator Delegator.

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorDelegator.sol#L160-L167
```solidity
function scrapeExcessFullWithdrawalETHFromEigenPod() external {
    uint256 ethWithdrawable = eigenPod.withdrawableRestakedExecutionLayerGwei().toWei();
    uint256 ethQueuedForWithdrawal = getETHQueuedForWithdrawal();
    if (ethWithdrawable <= ethQueuedForWithdrawal + MIN_EXCESS_FULL_WITHDRAWAL_ETH_FOR_SCRAPE) {
        revert INSUFFICIENT_EXCESS_FULL_WITHDRAWAL_ETH();
    }
    _queueWithdrawalForOperatorExitOrScrape(BEACON_CHAIN_STRATEGY, ethWithdrawable - ethQueuedForWithdrawal);
}
```

Once a validator has been deposited into, it can not be deposited into again even after it has exited. An attacker can then execute the following steps to block the LRT from restaking and gaining any yields from Eigenlayer:
- Attacker scrapes excess full withdrawal ETH which queues all the remaining ETH in the pod for withdrawal.
- Once the withdrawal has been completed and are in the Deposit Pool, rebalancing will re-deposit these ETH into Eigenlayer.
- Allocating ETH deposits will use up any remaining unallocated validators.
- Attacker can repeat this process until there are no more unallocated validators left and the ETH can no longer be deposited into Eigenlayer.

ref: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol#L431-L449
```solidity
uint256 unallocatedConfirmedKeys = validators.confirmed - validators.deposited;
if (unallocatedConfirmedKeys == 0) {
    skippedOperators[skippedOperatorCount++] = heap.extractMin();
    continue;
}

// Each allocation is a 32 ETH deposit. We can only allocate up to the number of unallocated confirmed keys.
uint256 updatedAllocation;
{
    uint256 newDepositAllocation = FixedPointMathLib.min(
        FixedPointMathLib.min(validators.cap - activeDeposits, unallocatedConfirmedKeys), remainingDeposits
    );

    // ... snip ...
    operator.validatorDetails.deposited += uint40(newDepositAllocation);
```

The code above is in `OperatorRegistry::allocateETHDeposits()` and it shows how the protocol can no longer deposit ETH once there are no more unallocated validators (`unallocatedConfirmedKeys` is 0.) 

## Impact
In this scenario, the LRT will not gain any staking yields since the attacker has effectively blocked the LRT from depositing into Eigenlayer. The LRT is no longer able to restake until more validator keys are added. However, the attacker can just repeat the attack.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider restricting access to `scrapeExcessFullWithdrawalETHFromEigenPod()` in the Operator Delegator. Allow only the Operator Manager and/or the Owner to access it.
