# Up to 1 ETH might get stuck in an EigenPod

## Summary
The function [RioLRTOperatorDelegator::scrapeExcessFullWithdrawalETHFromEigenPod()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorDelegator.sol#L160) doesn't allow to withdraw excess ETH if the excess is less than 1 ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function [RioLRTOperatorDelegator::scrapeExcessFullWithdrawalETHFromEigenPod()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorDelegator.sol#L160) is a permissionless function that can be called to retrieve ETH left in excess after a full withdrawal of a validator happens.

The function can't be called if the ETH in excess is less than a constant, `MIN_EXCESS_FULL_WITHDRAWAL_ETH_FOR_SCRAPE`. This constant is currently set at `1ETH`.

If the excess ETH left in the Eigenpod is less than `1ETH`, the function will revert making it impossible to recover the funds.

### POC
The POC shows that withdrawing `63.1ETH` when two validators have `64ETH` deposited will making it impossible to retrieve the remaining `0.9ETH`.

To copy-paste in `RioLRTOperatorDelegator.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_scrapeExcessFullWithdrawalETHFromEigenPodFails() public {
    uint8 operatorId = addOperatorDelegator(reETH.operatorRegistry, address(reETH.rewardDistributor));
    address operatorDelegator = reETH.operatorRegistry.getOperatorDetails(operatorId).delegator;

    uint256 TVL = 64 ether;
    uint256 WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT = 63.1 ether; //❌ Withdraw 63.1ETH

    // Allocate ETH.
    reETH.coordinator.depositETH{value: TVL - address(reETH.depositPool).balance}();

    // Push funds into EigenLayer.
    vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
    reETH.coordinator.rebalance(ETH_ADDRESS);

    // Verify validator withdrawal credentials.
    uint40[] memory validatorIndices = verifyCredentialsForValidators(reETH.operatorRegistry, operatorId, 2);

    // Withdraw some funds.
    reETH.coordinator.requestWithdrawal(ETH_ADDRESS, WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT); //❌ Withdraw 63.1ETH

    uint256 withdrawalEpoch = reETH.withdrawalQueue.getCurrentEpoch(ETH_ADDRESS);

    // Skip ahead and rebalance to queue the withdrawal within EigenLayer.
    skip(reETH.coordinator.rebalanceDelay());

    vm.prank(EOA, EOA);
    reETH.coordinator.rebalance(ETH_ADDRESS);

    // Verify and process two full validator exits.
    verifyAndProcessWithdrawalsForValidatorIndexes(operatorDelegator, validatorIndices);

    // Settle with withdrawal epoch.
    IDelegationManager.Withdrawal[] memory withdrawals = new IDelegationManager.Withdrawal[](1);
    withdrawals[0] = IDelegationManager.Withdrawal({
        staker: operatorDelegator,
        delegatedTo: address(1),
        withdrawer: address(reETH.withdrawalQueue),
        nonce: 0,
        startBlock: 1,
        strategies: BEACON_CHAIN_STRATEGY.toArray(),
        shares: WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT.toArray()
    });
    reETH.withdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer(ETH_ADDRESS, withdrawalEpoch, withdrawals, new uint256[](1));

    // At this time, there should be excess ETH in the EigenPod.
    RioLRTOperatorDelegator delegatorContract = RioLRTOperatorDelegator(payable(operatorDelegator));
    uint256 SCRAPE_AMOUNT = TVL - WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT;

    assertEq(address(delegatorContract.eigenPod()).balance, SCRAPE_AMOUNT);
    assertEq(reETH.assetRegistry.getTVLForAsset(ETH_ADDRESS), SCRAPE_AMOUNT);
    assertEq(delegatorContract.getETHUnderManagement(), SCRAPE_AMOUNT);

    // Scrape the excess ETH to the deposit pool.
    delegatorContract.scrapeExcessFullWithdrawalETHFromEigenPod(); //❌ Reverts
}
```

## Impact
Some funds might get stuck in Eigenpods.

## Recommendation
Remove the minimum requirement to scrape excess ETH, or add another way to withdraw the funds in case they get stuck.
