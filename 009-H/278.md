# Operators undelegating via EigenLayer is not handled

## Summary
Operators undelegating via EigenLayer is not handled

## Vulnerability Detail
EigenLayer's DelegationManager has a feature that allows operators to [undelegate](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/6de01c6c16d6df44af15f0b06809dc160eac0ebf/src/contracts/core/DelegationManager.sol#L211) a staker

```solidity
    function undelegate(address staker) external onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_ENTER_WITHDRAWAL_QUEUE) returns (bytes32[] memory withdrawalRoots) {
        require(isDelegated(staker), "DelegationManager.undelegate: staker must be delegated to undelegate");
        require(!isOperator(staker), "DelegationManager.undelegate: operators cannot be undelegated");
        require(staker != address(0), "DelegationManager.undelegate: cannot undelegate zero address");
        address operator = delegatedTo[staker];
        require(
            msg.sender == staker ||
                msg.sender == operator ||
                msg.sender == _operatorDetails[operator].delegationApprover,
            "DelegationManager.undelegate: caller cannot undelegate staker"
        );

        ......

        if (strategies.length == 0) {
            withdrawalRoots = new bytes32[](0);
        } else {
            withdrawalRoots = new bytes32[](strategies.length);
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < strategies.length; i++) {
                IStrategy[] memory singleStrategy = new IStrategy[](1);
                uint256[] memory singleShare = new uint256[](1);
                singleStrategy[0] = strategies[i];
                singleShare[0] = shares[i];

                withdrawalRoots[i] = _removeSharesAndQueueWithdrawal({
                    staker: staker,
                    operator: operator,
                    withdrawer: staker,
                    strategies: singleStrategy,
                    shares: singleShare
                });
            }
        }
```

This queues a withdrawalRequest for the entire staked amount with the staker ie. in this case the OperatorDelegator contract, as the withdrawer. Hence the tokens would be going to the OperatorDelegator contract but it has no functionality to access these funds. In case of ETH, the passed amount will be seen as reward and split accordingly.
Also this would break the shares accounting as these shares are no longer availabe for withdrawal.

## Impact
Operators can cause entire staked tokens to be lost

## Code Snippet
eigenLayers undelegate functionality sets the staker as the withdrawer

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add functionality to handle these funds / acknowledge this operator trust
