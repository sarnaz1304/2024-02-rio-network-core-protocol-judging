# Hardcoded `receiveAsTokens = true` could lead to stuck funds in strategy

## Summary
During the completion of a withdraw process on Eigenlayer, if a strategy contract reverts then funds cannot be withdrawn. A workaround exists which is to call Eigenlayer contracts with `receiveAsToken = false`. However, due to hardcoded values in Rio, this workaround is not available leading to stuck/loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Completing a withdrawal on Rio takes place in two areas: 1) RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol `settleEpochFromEigenLayer()` and 2) RiolLRTDepositPool.sol `completeOperatorWithdrawalForAsset()`. In both functions, the parameter `receiveAsTokens` is set to `true`, indicating the intention to receive withdrawals in tokens instead of shares.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTDepositPool.sol#L144
```solidity
delegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawal(queuedWithdrawal, asset.toArray(), middlewareTimesIndex, true); //@audit receiveAsTokens set to true
```

When Eigenlayer executes`completeQueuedWithdrawal()`, the `withdraw` function of the strategy contract is called (if `receiveAsTokens` is set to true). https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol#L189C5-L196C6
```solidity
function withdrawSharesAsTokens(
        address recipient,
        IStrategy strategy,
        uint256 shares,
        IERC20 token
    ) external onlyDelegationManager {
        strategy.withdraw(recipient, token, shares);
    }
```

However, the strategy contract could revert due to a variety of reasons including: a) contract is malicious, or b) contract has insufficient liquidity,  or c) contract is paused, or d) contract has a bug. Eigenlayer takes this possibility into consideration as seen [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-eigenlayer/blob/main/src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol#L533-L534).

A workaround to this would be to call `completeQueuedWithdrawal()` again with `receiveAsTokens` set to `false`. This allows the caller to receive the withdrawal as shares in `DelegationManager.sol`. Caller can then go on to queue a new withdrawal from a different strategy to receive the withdrawal as tokens. This workaround was discussed in a previous Eigenlayer audit found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-eigenlayer-findings/issues/132).

The prescribed workaround however is not possible in Rio's contracts as the `receiveAsTokens` parameter is hardcoded to `true`.
## Impact
User and protocol funds may end up permanently stuck in a strategy.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allowing the `receiveAsTokens` parameter to be input as `false` will require significant re-design of Rio's contracts to handle such scenarios. So instead, protocol could consider adding emergency functions that can complete withdrawals with `receiveAsTokens = false` and direct the receiving tokens to either the deposit pool or withdraw queue.
