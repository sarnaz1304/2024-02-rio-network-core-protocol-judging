# Potential Under-Collateralization in Yield Vault Due to Unaccounted Losses in Withdrawal Logic

## Summary
 The vulnerability in the **queueTokenWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement** function arises from the failure to account for potential losses incurred by the Yield Vault's strategy when calculating share redemptions. This can lead to the under-collateralization of the Vault, as the number of shares withdrawn from operators may not reflect the reduced value of assets post-loss.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "Potential Under-Collateralization in Yield Vault Due to Unaccounted Losses in Withdrawal Logic" vulnerability in the provided code is that the function **queueTokenWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement** does not handle the scenario where the withdrawal logic fails for some reason, leading to unaccounted losses in the yield vault.

Specifically, in lines 123 to 130, the code iterates over the **operatorDeallocations** array, queues withdrawals for each delegator, and accumulates the total **sharesQueued**. However, if the withdrawal logic fails for a particular delegator (for example, due to a revert in the **queueWithdrawalForUserSettlement** function), the shares for that delegator will not be properly accounted for in the **sharesQueued** total.

As a result, if the withdrawal logic fails for one or more delegators, the total **sharesQueued** will be less than **sharesToWithdraw** (line 131), leading to potential under-collateralization in the yield vault as the actual amount withdrawn may be less than expected.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the fact that the function queueTokenWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement does not account for the possibility of unaccounted losses in the withdrawal logic. This could potentially lead to under-collateralization in the yield vault if the shares queued for withdrawal do not match the actual shares that should be withdrawn.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

```solidity
// This is a simplified version of the vulnerable function
// Assume the following contract interfaces for demonstration purposes
interface IRioLRTOperatorRegistry {
    function deallocateStrategyShares(address strategy, uint256 shares) external returns (bool);
}

interface IRioLRTOperatorDelegator {
    function queueWithdrawalForUserSettlement(address strategy, uint256 shares) external returns (bytes32);
}

contract Exploit {
    IRioLRTOperatorRegistry public operatorRegistry;
    address public strategy;
    
    constructor(address _operatorRegistry, address _strategy) {
        operatorRegistry = IRioLRTOperatorRegistry(_operatorRegistry);
        strategy = _strategy;
    }
    
    function exploit() public {
        // Assume the attacker has control over the operatorDeallocations array
        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyDeallocation[] memory operatorDeallocations = new IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyDeallocation[](1);
        operatorDeallocations[0].delegator = msg.sender; // Attacker's address
        operatorDeallocations[0].shares = 100; // Arbitrary number of shares
        
        // Call the vulnerable function with manipulated operatorDeallocations
        queueTokenWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(operatorRegistry, strategy, 50);
    }
    
    function queueTokenWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(
        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry operatorRegistry,
        address strategy,
        uint256 sharesToWithdraw
    ) internal returns (bytes32 aggregateRoot) {
        (, IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyDeallocation[] memory operatorDeallocations) = operatorRegistry.deallocateStrategyShares(strategy, sharesToWithdraw);
        bytes32[] memory roots = new bytes32[](operatorDeallocations.length);
        
        uint256 sharesQueued;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < operatorDeallocations.length; ++i) {
            address delegator = operatorDeallocations[i].delegator;
            uint256 shares = operatorDeallocations[i].shares;
            
            sharesQueued += shares;
            roots[i] = IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(delegator).queueWithdrawalForUserSettlement(strategy, shares);
        }
        
        if (sharesToWithdraw != sharesQueued) revert; // Exploit the vulnerability
        
        aggregateRoot = keccak256(abi.encode(roots));
    }
}
```

In the PoC code, the attacker manipulates the **operatorDeallocations** array to withdraw fewer shares than actually queued. This can lead to under-collateralization in the yield vault due to unaccounted losses in the withdrawal logic.

## Impact
 If not addressed, this could result in the socialization of losses among remaining shareholders, as the assets backing their shares could become insufficient, posing a risk of protocol insolvency.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we can introduce a check to ensure that the total shares withdrawn from the operators match the shares requested by the user. This can be done by calculating the total shares queued during the loop and comparing it with the sharesToWithdraw parameter before returning the aggregateRoot.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to address this vulnerability:

```solidity
113       function queueTokenWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(
114           IRioLRTOperatorRegistry operatorRegistry,
115           address strategy,
116           uint256 sharesToWithdraw
117       ) internal returns (bytes32 aggregateRoot) {
118           (, IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyDeallocation[] memory operatorDeallocations) = operatorRegistry.deallocateStrategyShares(
119               strategy, sharesToWithdraw
120           );
121           bytes32[] memory roots = new bytes32[](operatorDeallocations.length);
122   
123           uint256 sharesQueued;
124           for (uint256 i = 0; i < operatorDeallocations.length; ++i) {
125               address delegator = operatorDeallocations[i].delegator;
126               uint256 shares = operatorDeallocations[i].shares;
127   
128               sharesQueued += shares;
129               roots[i] = IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(delegator).queueWithdrawalForUserSettlement(strategy, shares);
130           }
131           if (sharesToWithdraw != sharesQueued) revert INCORRECT_NUMBER_OF_SHARES_QUEUED();
132   
133           // Add a check to ensure total shares withdrawn match shares requested
134           uint256 actualSharesWithdrawn = calculateActualSharesWithdrawn(strategy, roots);
135           require(sharesToWithdraw == actualSharesWithdrawn, "Actual shares withdrawn do not match requested shares");
136   
137           aggregateRoot = keccak256(abi.encode(roots));
138       }

139       function calculateActualSharesWithdrawn(address strategy, bytes32[] memory roots) internal returns (uint256) {
140           uint256 totalSharesWithdrawn;
141           for (uint256 i = 0; i < roots.length; i++) {
142               totalSharesWithdrawn += IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(roots[i]).getWithdrawnShares(strategy);
143           }
144           return totalSharesWithdrawn;
145 }
```
In this patched code, we added a new function **calculateActualSharesWithdrawn** to calculate the total shares actually withdrawn based on the **roots** array. We then compare this total with the **sharesToWithdraw** parameter to ensure that they match before proceeding. This check helps prevent potential under-collateralization in the yield vault due to unaccounted losses in the withdrawal logic.
