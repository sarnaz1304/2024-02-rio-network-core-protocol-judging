# Unbounded loops for epoch rebalance breaking the protocol

## Summary
To facilitate deposits into EigenLayer and to process 1-day withdrawals from the Rio LRT, there is an automated process that is run called the [Deposit Pool Rebalancer](https://github.com/contracts-and-tooling/source-code/restaking/riolrtcoordinator#rebalance). This function is called via the [Coordinator](https://github.com/rio-architecture/token-issuance#coordinator).

The rest of the assets deposited by users will be sent to Eigenlayer through the operators that are returned from the registry. The allocation is based on the specified amount of assets deposited to the operators with the lowest utilization.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem with the allocation is that multiple unbound loops loop all the operators and sort them based on utilization, then perform an unbound loop again to delegate the assets to the validators, then each validators stake the assets. Knowing that the max operator is 64, but there isn't a known MAX cap of validators per operator (it can be set via the DAO). 

Assuming the max operator is 64 and validators can be hundreds and thousands.
The `IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(delegator).queueWithdrawalForUserSettlement` calls the other 2 functions based on ETH/token queues for ETH/Token withdrawals from EigenLayer through the operators that are returned from the registry. But for the following example will be using Eth transactions. 

The `RioLRTCoordinator()::queueETHWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement` queues ETH withdrawals from EigenLayer through **all**operators that are returned from the registry.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorOperations.sol#L97
```solidity
// RioLRTCoordinator()::queueETHWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) { //@audit unbound loops
            address delegator = operatorDepositDeallocations[i].delegator;
        
            // Ensure we do not send more than needed to the withdrawal queue. The remaining will stay in the Eigen Pod.
            uint256 amountToWithdraw = (i == length - 1) ? remainingAmount : operatorDepositDeallocations[i].deposits * ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE;
            remainingAmount -= amountToWithdraw;
            roots[i] = IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(delegator).queueWithdrawalForUserSettlement(BEACON_CHAIN_STRATEGY, amountToWithdraw);
        }
```
Eigenlayer process the queue
https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/6de01c6c16d6df44af15f0b06809dc160eac0ebf/src/contracts/core/DelegationManager.sol#L273
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < queuedWithdrawalParams.length; i++) {
            require(queuedWithdrawalParams[i].strategies.length == queuedWithdrawalParams[i].shares.length, "DelegationManager.queueWithdrawal: input length mismatch");
            require(queuedWithdrawalParams[i].withdrawer != address(0), "DelegationManager.queueWithdrawal: must provide valid withdrawal address");


            // Remove shares from staker's strategies and place strategies/shares in queue.
            // If the staker is delegated to an operator, the operator's delegated shares are also reduced
            // NOTE: This will fail if the staker doesn't have the shares implied by the input parameters
            withdrawalRoots[i] = _removeSharesAndQueueWithdrawal({
                staker: msg.sender,
                operator: operator,
                withdrawer: queuedWithdrawalParams[i].withdrawer,
                strategies: queuedWithdrawalParams[i].strategies,
                shares: queuedWithdrawalParams[i].shares
            });
        }
```


Afterward, **each operator** deposits ETH into EigenLayer are returned from the registry.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorOperations.sol#L36
```solidity
// RioLRTDepositPool()::depositETHToOperators
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < allocations.length; ++i) { //@audit unbound loops
            uint256 deposits = allocations[i].deposits;

            IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(allocations[i].delegator).stakeETH{value: deposits * ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE}(
                deposits, allocations[i].pubKeyBatch, allocations[i].signatureBatch
            );
        }
```
Lastly, it goes through the final nested loop and stake ETH via the operator delegator's EigenPod, using the **each**provided validator information.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorDelegator.sol#L199
```solidity
//RioLRTOperatorDelegator()::stakeETH

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < validatorCount; ++i) { //@audit unbound loops
            Memory.copyBytes(pubkeyBatch, publicKey, i * BLS_PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH, 0, BLS_PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH);
            Memory.copyBytes(signatureBatch, signature, i * BLS_SIGNATURE_LENGTH, 0, BLS_SIGNATURE_LENGTH);
            depositDataRoot = _computeDepositDataRoot(withdrawalCredentials_, publicKey, signature);
            // @note EigenPodManager is used for Native Ether only
            eigenPodManager.stake{value: ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE}(publicKey, signature, depositDataRoot);
        }
```
The eigenPodManager.stake deposit Eth with the pod.
https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/6de01c6c16d6df44af15f0b06809dc160eac0ebf/src/contracts/pods/EigenPodManager.sol#L90C1-L101C6
```solidity
    function stake(
        bytes calldata pubkey, 
        bytes calldata signature, 
        bytes32 depositDataRoot
    ) external payable onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_NEW_EIGENPODS) {
        IEigenPod pod = ownerToPod[msg.sender];
        if (address(pod) == address(0)) {
            //deploy a pod if the sender doesn't have one already
            pod = _deployPod();
        }
        pod.stake{value: msg.value}(pubkey, signature, depositDataRoot);
    }
```
## Impact
The amount of nested unbound loops is concerning and can lead to the block gas limit causing the transaction to constantly fail. Halfway through the execution fails due to exceeding the block size gas limit.

## Code Snippet
The following are the simulated example for ETH transactions:
```solidity
RioLRTCoordinator::rebalance
--RioLRTCoordinator()::_processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch
---RioLRTDepositPool().transferMaxAssetsForShares

-----RioLRTCoordinator()::queueETHWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement // (Contains Loops)
------RioLRTOperatorDelegator().queueWithdrawalForUserSettlement
-------RioLRTOperatorDelegator()::_increaseETHQueuedForUserSettlement // If ETH
--------RioLRTOperatorDelegator()::_queueWithdrawal 
---------Eigenlayer's delegationManager().queueWithdrawals 
----------RioLRTWithdrawalQueue()::queueCurrentEpochSettlement
-----------RioLRTDepositPool()::depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer
------------RioLRTDepositPool()::depositETHToOperators // (Contains Loops)
-------------RioLRTOperatorDelegator()::stakeETH //(Contains Loops)
--------------Eigenlayer's eigenPodManager.stake
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using fewer loops and map only to the validators that are not full. Ordered lists are much more work and often unnecessary, which is why we should avoid them and consolidate multiple loops into a single loop and skip the "stored validated fully utilized" in another mapping, looping only the "underutilized validators" mapping. This can be done with another abstracted function that can create a mapping of low or highly-utilized validators.
