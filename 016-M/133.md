# Possible arbitrage from Chainlink price discrepancy

## Summary
The protocol calculates the amount of tokenl based on Chainlink quotes, and Chainlink quotes are not real-time, which introduces deviations. This creates an arbitrage opportunity.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `RioLRTCoordinator.deposit()` function, the protocol first converts the asset amount into the `Unit Of Account`, and then converts the `Unit Of Account` into restaking tokens. The conversion of assets into the Unit Of Account relies on the Chainlink oracle for price conversion.
```solidity
    function deposit(address asset, uint256 amountIn) external checkDeposit(asset, amountIn) returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        // Convert deposited asset amount to restaking tokens.
        amountOut = convertFromAssetToRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn);

        // Pull tokens from the sender to the deposit pool.
        IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(depositPool()), amountIn);

```

 Similarly, in the `requestWithdrawal()` function, the protocol converts restaking tokens into shares, also utilizing the Chainlink oracle. 
```solidity
    function requestWithdrawal(address asset, uint256 amountIn) external checkWithdrawal(asset, amountIn) returns (uint256 sharesOwed) {
        // Determine the amount of shares owed to the withdrawer using the current exchange rate.
        sharesOwed = convertToSharesFromRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn);

        // If requesting ETH, reduce the precision of the shares owed to the nearest Gwei,
        // which is the smallest unit of account supported by EigenLayer.
        if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) sharesOwed = sharesOwed.reducePrecisionToGwei();
```

It's important to note that Chainlink oracles do not provide real-time prices and have a certain deviation [-x, x]. For instance, in the protocol, the [reth/eth](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=ethereum&page=1&search=reth) price feed has a deviation of about [-2%, 2%], which means that the nodes may not update an on-chain price unless the boundaries are reached within a 24-hour period. If the collateral price is at its maximum (+2%) during `deposit()` and at its minimum (-2%) during `requestWithdrawal()`, an arbitrage opportunity arises.


## Impact
Attacker can gain profit and the protocol can lose asset.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1.Use multiple price feeds to potentially close any profitable opportunities;
2.Do not allow user to redeem right after mint.
