# Attacker can front-run rewards distribution to be awarded unfairly which decreases the yield for honest users

## Summary
Rewards are distributed to users of the Rio protocol when yield is acrrued from delegating user funds to Eigen Layer. This includes both full and partial withdrawals from Eigen. The sole entry point for rewards in the protocol is the `RioLRTRewardDistributor` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
When rewards from Eigen Layer are received, the `poolShare` is calculated then eth is [sent directly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTRewardDistributor.sol#L91) to the deposit pool.

When a user wants to cash in their LRT's for underlying asset, they are to [request a withdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L99-L116). The `sharesOwed` variable which represents how much value the user is going to receive back, leads to getting the [TVL](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol#L73C22-L73C36) from the asset registry. When rewards are distributed to the deposit pool, no new LRT is minted whilst the underlying asset's TVL increases since the balance of the pool is accounted, thus the value of shares increases.

The issue is that Alice can deposit right before a reward is to be distributed and back-run the distribution with a withdrawal request. This would allow her to receive the same amount of rewards as honest Bob who has staked for e.g. a month in the protocol. Alice's funds will never have even been delegated to Eigen strategies/AVS tasks and she unfairly gains the same rewards as honest users.

Withdrawal requests are processed in batches (epochs). An attempt to settle an epoch can be made [once per 24h](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L148) by the rebalancer bot (or any user) calling rebalance. [Upon attempting a rebalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L126-L129), if funds in the deposit pool are [sufficient to complete all requests, the epoch is settled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L252-L258) and users can [claim their withdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L92-L108).

```solidity
        epochWithdrawals.users[withdrawer].claimed = true;

        amountOut = userSummary.sharesOwed.mulDiv(epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived, epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed);
        request.asset.transferTo(withdrawer, amountOut);
```

What also makes this protocol a suitable target for such a sandwich attack/stepwise jump attacks is:

1. **No minimum amount of time that funds need to be locked in the protocol before requesting a withdrawal is available**
2. The protocol will have [multiple LRT deployments](https://docs.rio.network/rio-architecture/token-issuance) each with its own separate reward distributors which gives more targets
3. Each LRT can have multiple underlying assets and each rebalance attempt for asset A is different from rebalance attempt for asset B, once again multiple targets
4. Queuing new withdrawal requests does not push back the rebalance timer
5. Intended launch on mainnet so front/back-running is possible

## Impact
Gave it high severity since sandwich attack of rewards distribution decreases the yield of honest users. If large amounts of tokens are deposited, the attacker can steal most rewards.

## Code Snippet
Proof of concept:

1. Add `import {Test, console2} from "forge-std/Test.sol";` to RioLRTCoordinator.t.sol
2. Change the contract to: `contract RioLRTCoordinatorTest is Test, RioDeployer {`
3. Add the test below and run with `forge test --mt testMEV -vvvv`

Manual Review/Foundry

## Recommendation
Require users to have delegated funds for a minimum amount of time before allowing withdrawal requests.
