# Potential Disruption in Epoch Lifecycle Management

## Summary
The absence of time-based constraints on epoch settlements and withdrawal processing can lead to unpredictable lifecycle management within the system. Without these constraints, epochs can be settled prematurely, or withdrawals could be processed out of their intended schedule, potentially disrupting the orderly flow of transactions and settlements. This lack of predictability can undermine the integrity of the contract's operational logic, affecting user confidence and the overall system's reliability.

## Vulnerability Detail
The RioLRTWithdrawalQueue contract does not implement any mechanisms to enforce temporal boundaries around the initiation and completion of epoch settlements and withdrawal requests. In decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, epochs are typically used to batch processes and transactions within a defined timeframe. The absence of these time-based checks allows for the possibility of operations being executed at arbitrary times, which could lead to operational inefficiencies, gaming of the system, or unexpected financial implications for users.

## Impact
Currently, functions such as `settleCurrentEpoch` and `claimWithdrawalsForEpoch` lack checks to ensure they are executed within a specific timeframe relative to the epoch they are processing:

```solidity
function settleCurrentEpoch(address asset, uint256 assetsReceived, uint256 shareValueOfAssetsReceived)
    external
    onlyCoordinator
{
    // No time-based checks before settling an epoch
}

function claimWithdrawalsForEpoch(ClaimRequest calldata request) public returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    // No checks on timing for claims
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a mechanism that defines the start and end times for each epoch. Ensure that epoch settlement and withdrawal claims can only be processed within the appropriate timeframe. This could involve adding a mapping to track the start and end times of each epoch and including `require` statements to validate the current block timestamp against these values.

First, introduce a structure to hold epoch timing information:

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => EpochTiming)) internal epochTimingsByAsset;

struct EpochTiming {
    uint256 startTime;
    uint256 endTime;
}
```

Then, ensure that the `settleCurrentEpoch` and `claimWithdrawalsForEpoch` functions check that the current time is within the allowable range for the given operation:

```solidity
function settleCurrentEpoch(address asset, uint256 assetsReceived, uint256 shareValueOfAssetsReceived)
    external
    onlyCoordinator
{
    uint256 currentEpoch = getCurrentEpoch(asset);
    require(block.timestamp >= epochTimingsByAsset[asset][currentEpoch].startTime, "Epoch settlement not started");
    require(block.timestamp <= epochTimingsByAsset[asset][currentEpoch].endTime, "Epoch settlement period ended");
    // Settlement logic...
}

function claimWithdrawalsForEpoch(ClaimRequest calldata request) public returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    require(block.timestamp >= epochTimingsByAsset[request.asset][request.epoch].endTime, "Withdrawal period not started");
    // Claim logic...
}
```
