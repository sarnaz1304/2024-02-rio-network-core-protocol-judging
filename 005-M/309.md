# `RioLRTDepositPool:depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer` reverts when asset to share calculation rounds down

## Summary

Upon depositting ERC20 tokens into `EigenLayer`, the conversion from asset to share may result in rounding down.
If the rounding down would happen, the `RioLRTDepositPool:depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer` will fail.

It is also possible to send some dust into the strategy therefore to force the asset to share conversion to round down and the deposit would fail.



## Vulnerability Detail

https://gist.github.com/lemonmon1984/6a0728dc8b614d4fda3806570279e379

The full test code can be found the above gist. Relevant part is copied below:

```solidity
    function test_depositBalanceIntoEigenLayerERC20DepositRevertWhenRound_poc() public {
        // send money to the strategy
        // to make it round down
        cbETH.mint(CBETH_STRATEGY, 111);

        uint256 initialBalance = cbETH.balanceOf(address(reLST.depositPool));
        uint256 amount = 1999e18-1;

        addOperatorDelegators(reLST.operatorRegistry, address(reLST.rewardDistributor), 10);
        cbETH.mint(address(reLST.depositPool), amount);

        vm.prank(address(reLST.coordinator));

        vm.expectRevert(OperatorOperations.INCORRECT_NUMBER_OF_SHARES_RECEIVED.selector);
        (uint256 sharesReceived,) = reLST.depositPool.depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer(CBETH_ADDRESS);
    }
```

In the scenario above:
1. `cbETH` was minted to `CBETH_STRATEGY`. It is to make the asset to share conversion to round down. Note that anybody can send the `cbETH` token to the strategy, as the strategy will use the balance of the token to convert between the underlyint asset and the share.

1. operator delegator was added as usual
1. `chETH` was minted to the `depositPool` to simulate user's deposit
1. as coordinator the `RioLRTDepositPool.BalanceIntoEigenLayer` was triggered and it will revert.

### Details

The `RioLRTDepositPool:depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer` calls `OperatorOperations.depositTokenToOperators` with the amount of `sharesToAllocate`.

The `OperatorOperations.depositTokenToOperators` will use `operatorRegistry.allocateStrategyShares` to get the allocation information. And then use these allocations to actually stake by calling `IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(allocation.delegator).stakeERC20(strategy, token, allocation.tokens)`. The actually received shares value is expected to sum up to the `sharesToAllocate` given by the depositPool.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorOperations.sol#L57-L67

The problem is that there are multiple conversion from asset to shares in these steps and each of calculation is rounding down.

```solidity
shares:sharesToAllocate --[sharesToUnderlyingView](rounddown)--> assets:allocation.tokens --[stakeERC20](rounddown)--> shares:sharesReceived
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol#L363-L368

```solidity
// stake to strategy (EightLayer) uses the following formular
// to convert the asset `amount` to the shares
        newShares = (amount * virtualShareAmount) / virtualPriorTokenBalance;
```


For the likely cases of share and asset conversion involves rounding down, the `sharesReceived` will not sum up to `sharesToAllocate` and it will revert:

## Impact

For most of the time 
`RioLRTDepositPool:depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer` will revert, therefore the functionality including `rebalance` is compromised. Even if when the deposit would not revert, an attacker can cheaply front run to force the deposit to revert.

## Recommendation

consider using allow presicion error upon comparing the `sharesReceived` and `sharesAllocated`
