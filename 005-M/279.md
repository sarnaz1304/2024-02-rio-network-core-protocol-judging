# Strict check for precalculated shares to equal the actual shares received will revert often due to rounding in eigenlayer

## Summary
Strict check for precalculated shares to equal the actual shares received will revert often due to rounding in eigenlayer

## Vulnerability Detail
Deposits to EigenLayer will revert in case the percalculated shares is not equal to the actual received shares

```solidity
    function depositTokenToOperators(
        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry operatorRegistry,
        address token,
        address strategy,
        uint256 sharesToAllocate
    ) internal returns (uint256 sharesReceived) {
        (uint256 sharesAllocated, IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyAllocation[] memory  allocations) = operatorRegistry.allocateStrategyShares(
            strategy, sharesToAllocate
        );


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < allocations.length; ++i) {
            IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyAllocation memory allocation = allocations[i];


            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(allocation.delegator, allocation.tokens);
            sharesReceived += IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(allocation.delegator).stakeERC20(strategy, token, allocation.tokens);
        }
=>      if (sharesReceived != sharesAllocated) revert INCORRECT_NUMBER_OF_SHARES_RECEIVED();
    }
```

The relevant flow is as follows:
1. Given `sharesToAllocate`, find the amount of tokens that is to be staked in order to receive this amount (or max possible amount) of shares. This is done by calling the `sharesToUnderlyingView` function in EigenLayer's strategy.

```solidity
function sharesToUnderlyingView(uint256 amountShares) public view virtual override returns (uint256) {
        
        uint256 virtualTotalShares = totalShares + SHARES_OFFSET;
        uint256 virtualTokenBalance = _tokenBalance() + BALANCE_OFFSET;
        
=>      return (virtualTokenBalance * amountShares) / virtualTotalShares;
    }
```

2. Deposit to EigenLayer with the earlier calculated amount of tokens. Corresponding shares are calculated inside the deposit function as follows:

```solidity
function deposit(
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount
    ) external virtual override onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_DEPOSITS) onlyStrategyManager returns (uint256 newShares) {
        
        ....

        uint256 virtualShareAmount = priorTotalShares + SHARES_OFFSET;
        uint256 virtualTokenBalance = _tokenBalance() + BALANCE_OFFSET;
        
        uint256 virtualPriorTokenBalance = virtualTokenBalance - amount;
=>      newShares = (amount * virtualShareAmount) / virtualPriorTokenBalance;

       .....
    }
```

Due to rounding inside both the functions the following is possible often:
1. sharesToAllocate = s
2. Obtained token amount = a
3. sharesReceived for depositing `a` amount of tokens = d
4. d < s

This will cause the call to revert

### POC
Add the following lines of code to `test/RioLRTDepositPool.t.sol` and run `forge test --mt testHash_depositRevertDueToRounding`

```solidity
    error INCORRECT_NUMBER_OF_SHARES_RECEIVED();
    function testHash_depositRevertDueToRounding() public {

        uint256 amount = 1e18;

        addOperatorDelegators(reLST.operatorRegistry, address(reLST.rewardDistributor), 10);
        cbETH.mint(address(reLST.depositPool), amount);

        vm.prank(address(reLST.coordinator));

        (uint256 sharesReceived,) = reLST.depositPool.depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer(CBETH_ADDRESS);
        assertEq(sharesReceived, 1e18);
        assertEq(cbETH.balanceOf(CBETH_STRATEGY), 1e18);

        // now balance = 1e18 and shares = 1e18
        // if 10 cbeth is added to strategy balance, the next deposit will revert due to differences caused by rounding

        cbETH.mint(address(CBETH_STRATEGY), 10);

        cbETH.mint(address(reLST.depositPool), amount);

        vm.prank(address(reLST.coordinator));

        vm.expectRevert(INCORRECT_NUMBER_OF_SHARES_RECEIVED.selector);
        reLST.depositPool.depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer(CBETH_ADDRESS);  
    }
```

## Impact
Deposits will revert often

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Currently accurate predictions are necessary due to how the operator utilization is implemented. This would have to be changed to eliminate the accurate precalculation
