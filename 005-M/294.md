# Depositing tokens to EigenLayer strategy reverts because of dust differences.

## Summary
When depositing tokens to EigenLayer strategy, it checks if expected shares is same as actual shares deposited, if different it reverts. However, when calculating actual shares there comes rounding down maths that generates dust difference to end result, thus it causes revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
OperatorOperations.sol:L57-L67
```Solidity
function depositTokenToOperators(
    IRioLRTOperatorRegistry operatorRegistry,
    address token,
    address strategy,
    uint256 sharesToAllocate
) internal returns (uint256 sharesReceived) {
    (uint256 sharesAllocated, IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyAllocation[] memory  allocations) = operatorRegistry.allocateStrategyShares(
        strategy, sharesToAllocate
    );

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < allocations.length; ++i) {
        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyAllocation memory allocation = allocations[i];

        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(allocation.delegator, allocation.tokens);
        sharesReceived += IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(allocation.delegator).stakeERC20(strategy, token, allocation.tokens);
    }
    if (sharesReceived != sharesAllocated) revert INCORRECT_NUMBER_OF_SHARES_RECEIVED();
}
```
When depositing to EigenLayer's strategy, following steps are executed:
1. Input - number of shares to allocate
2. Amount of tokens is calculated using shares above. -> Rounding down
3. The calculated amount of tokens is passed to EigenLayer's strategy.
4. EigenLayer's strategy returns actual shares increased. -> Rounding down

During the deposit, two rounding down math is done thus converting shares to tokens, again tokens to shares.
So there must exist dust difference between input shares and output shares.
Thus, the share comparison at the end of the function will revert which means deposit does not work.

## Impact
Deposit feature is broken and will revert most of the times.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rather than strict check, it should allow dust difference.
