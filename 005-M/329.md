# `rebalance()` might revert unreasonably by improper checking in `OperatorOperation.depositTokenToOperators()`.

## Summary
In `OperatorOperation.depositTokenToOperators()`, `sharesAllocated` is the sum of shares calculated by using `sharesToUnderlyingView` function, and `sharesReceived` is the sum of shares from `depositIntoStrategy()`. 

As `depositIntoStrategy()` changes the strategy's state every time, there might be some differences between `sharesAllocated` and `sharesReceived`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`depositTokenToOperators()` checks if `sharesReceived` equals to `sharesAllocated` after the staking.

```javascript
    function depositTokenToOperators(
        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry operatorRegistry,
        address token,
        address strategy,
        uint256 sharesToAllocate
    ) internal returns (uint256 sharesReceived) {
        (uint256 sharesAllocated, IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyAllocation[] memory  allocations) = operatorRegistry.allocateStrategyShares(
            strategy, sharesToAllocate
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < allocations.length; ++i) {
            IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyAllocation memory allocation = allocations[i];

            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(allocation.delegator, allocation.tokens);
            sharesReceived += IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(allocation.delegator).stakeERC20(strategy, token, allocation.tokens);
        }
@>67    if (sharesReceived != sharesAllocated) revert INCORRECT_NUMBER_OF_SHARES_RECEIVED();
    }
```

`sharesReceived` means the sum of received shares after deposit funds to `strategyManager` and `strategyManager.depositIntoStrategy()` updates the strategy's shares/asset amounts every time. 

But `sharesAllocated` is calculated using `sharesToUnderlyingView()` which is a view function. So all calculations will be done with the current strategy state.

There wouldn't be huge differences but these two amounts might be different slightly if `depositIntoStrategy()` is called several times during the `sharesReceived` calculation.

## Impact

`RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance()` will be reverted unreasonably because of the improper validation.

## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
We should introduce a different logic to validate the allocated/received shares.
