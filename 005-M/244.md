# `rebalance()` could be reverted unreasonably by improper checking in `OperatorOperation.depositTokenToOperators()`.

## Summary

In `OperatorOperation.depositTokenToOperators()`, `sharesReceived == sharesAllocated` is checked. 
However,`sharesReceived` is the sum of shares calculated by using `strategy.sharesToUnderlyingView()` function, and `sharesAllocated` is the sum of shares transfered from strategy by calling `strategy.deposit()`. `sharesToUnderlyingView()` is a view function, but `deposit()` is not. This may lead to small differences of `sharesReceived` and `sharesAllocated` from rounding error.

```javascript
    function depositTokenToOperators(
        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry operatorRegistry,
        address token,
        address strategy,
        uint256 sharesToAllocate
    ) internal returns (uint256 sharesReceived) {
        (uint256 sharesAllocated, IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyAllocation[] memory  allocations) = operatorRegistry.allocateStrategyShares(
            strategy, sharesToAllocate
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < allocations.length; ++i) {
            IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyAllocation memory allocation = allocations[i];

            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(allocation.delegator, allocation.tokens);
            sharesReceived += IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(allocation.delegator).stakeERC20(strategy, token, allocation.tokens);
        }
@>67    if (sharesReceived != sharesAllocated) revert INCORRECT_NUMBER_OF_SHARES_RECEIVED();
    }
```

`sharesReceived == sharesAllocated` is checked at L67. `sharesReceived` and `sharesAllocated` are calculated in different ways. `sharesReceived` is the sum of shares calculated by using `sharesToUnderlyingView()` function, and `sharesAllocated` is the sum of shares transfered from strategy by calling `deposit()`. 
If `deposit()` is called once, the returning value will be equal to that of `sharesToUnderlyingView()`. But `deposit()` is called several times. Every calling make some modidifications of states, this may affect the returning value of subsequent callings.

## Impact

`RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance()` will be reverted unreasonably.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`sharesAllocated` should be set same as `sharesReceived`.
