# Wrong accounting of ethBalanceInUnverifiedValidators when validating withdraw credentials

## Summary
After calling `verifyWithdrawalCredentials` the value of `ethBalanceInUnverifiedValidators` is decreased exactly 32 ether for each validator verified. But this amount does not necesarily have to be equal to the amount recorded in the EigenPodManager of Eigenlayer, potentially leading to an accounting mismatch, because `ethBalanceInUnverifiedValidators` is used in the computation of the LRT TVL.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `verifyWithdrawalCredentials` is invoked, there is a call to `decreaseUnverifiedValidatorETHBalance` passing in the number of validators times `ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE` which is hardcoded to 32 ether:
```solidity
function verifyWithdrawalCredentials(
	uint8 operatorId,
	uint64 oracleTimestamp,
	IBeaconChainProofs.StateRootProof calldata stateRootProof,
	uint40[] calldata validatorIndices,
	bytes[] calldata validatorFieldsProofs,
	bytes32[][] calldata validatorFields
) external onlyOperatorManagerOrProofUploader(operatorId) {
	OperatorDetails storage operator = s.operatorDetails[operatorId];
	IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(operator.delegator).verifyWithdrawalCredentials(
		oracleTimestamp, stateRootProof, validatorIndices, validatorFieldsProofs, validatorFields
	);

	// Once verified, shares are tracked as EigenPod shares.
	assetRegistry().decreaseUnverifiedValidatorETHBalance(validatorIndices.length * ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE);

	emit OperatorWithdrawalCredentialsVerified(operatorId, oracleTimestamp, validatorIndices);
}
```

`verifyWithdrawalCredentials` in `RioLRTOperatorDelegator` eventually calls `verifyWithdrawalCredentials` in the Eigen Pod, which, as can be seen below, records in the Eigen Pod manager the total amount to be restaked.

https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/6de01c6c16d6df44af15f0b06809dc160eac0ebf/src/contracts/pods/EigenPod.sol#L344

And this amount does not have to be necesarily equal to a multiple of 32 ether (validators can be slashed, for instance).

So the value of the TVL of the LRT can be affected and not reflect it's real total value locked. The flow to calculate the TVL is:

RioLRTAssetRegistry:**getTVL**
  |-> RioLRTAssetRegistry:**getTVLForAsset**
    |-> RioLRTAssetRegistry:**getTotalBalanceForAsset**
      |-> RioLRTAssetRegistry:**getETHBalanceInEigenLayer**
	  
In this last call we can see `ethBalanceInUnverifiedValidators` is used in the calculation, so if it was wrong it would certainly affect the TVL amount.
```solidity
function getETHBalanceInEigenLayer() public view returns (uint256 balance) {
	balance = ethBalanceInUnverifiedValidators;

	IRioLRTOperatorRegistry operatorRegistry_ = operatorRegistry();
	uint8 endAtID = operatorRegistry_.operatorCount() + 1; // Operator IDs start at 1.
	for (uint8 id = 1; id < endAtID; ++id) {
		balance += operatorDelegator(operatorRegistry_, id).getETHUnderManagement();
	}
}
```
		
As `getTVL` is used in the calls to `convertFromUnitOfAccountToRestakingTokens` and `convertToUnitOfAccountFromRestakingTokens`, a wrong value would propagate and produce, for instance, that a call to `depositETH` would mint an incorrect amount of the LRT to the depositor.


## Impact
High, accounting mismatch can lead to loss of funds to stakers.

## Tool used
Manual review.


## Recommendation
The call to `decreaseUnverifiedValidatorETHBalance` in `verifyWithdrawalCredentials` should be done passing the actual amount recorded in Eigenlayer.
