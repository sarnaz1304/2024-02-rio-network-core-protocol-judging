# `RioLRTAVSRegistry.isActiveSlashingContract` can return wrong values if slashing contract is used by multiple AVSs

## Summary

If multiple AVSs use the same slashing contract, the slashing contract will be activated or deactivated for all AVSs at once.

## Vulnerability Detail

`RioLRTAVSRegistry` stores the AVSs that Operators can register for and subsequently opt into their slashing contracts.

`addAVS` allows the contract owner to add a new AVS to the registry. If the AVS has a slashing contract this [is flagged as active](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTAVSRegistry.sol#L74-L76).

The functions `activateAVS` and `deactivateAVS` also change the status of the slashing contract to [active](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTAVSRegistry.sol#L93-L95) or [inactive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTAVSRegistry.sol#L112-L114) respectively.

The issue is that if the same slashing contract is used by multiple AVSs, `activateAVS` and `deactivateAVS` will activate or deactivate the slashing contract for all AVSs at once.

## Impact

The `RioLRTAVSRegistry` contract is not integrated with the rest of the system yet, so it is hard to determine the exact outcome of this issue. However, we can predict that all operations relying on a call to `isActiveSlashingContract` can result in unexpected behavior.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check on `addAVS` to ensure that the slashing contract is not already used in another AVS.
