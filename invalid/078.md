# Deposit transaction may fail due to out-of-gas and cause temporary DoS

## Summary
There is no limit on how many tokens can be added to the system. This can be problematic when the function `RioLRTCoordinator::getTVL()` is called. 
This function is called during the user `deposit`. The complete deposit flow contains several external calls and a for loop over the tokens array with nested external calls. The transaction after a few added tokens to the system can be extremely expensive or, more likely run out of gas and cause unexpected DoS

## Vulnerability Detail
Deposit flow with respected call depth:
`RioLRTCoordinator::deposit` 
- `convertFromAssetToRestakingTokens` 
    - ExternalCall `assetRegistry().convertToUnitOfAccountFromAsset()` 
        - ExternalCall `IPriceFeed(priceFeed).getPrice()`
    - `convertFromUnitOfAccountToRestakingTokens`
        - `getTVL()`
            - ExternalCall `assetRegistry().getTVL()`
                - **In For loop over all the tokens** `getTVLForAsset`
                    - Here is the following function:
                    
```solidity
    function getTotalBalanceForAsset(address asset) public view returns (uint256) {
        if (!isSupportedAsset(asset)) revert ASSET_NOT_SUPPORTED(asset);

        address depositPool_ = address(depositPool());
        if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) {
            return depositPool_.balance + getETHBalanceInEigenLayer();
        }

        uint256 sharesHeld = getAssetSharesHeld(asset);
        uint256 tokensInRio = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(depositPool_);
        uint256 tokensInEigenLayer = convertFromSharesToAsset(getAssetStrategy(asset), sharesHeld);

        return tokensInRio + tokensInEigenLayer;
    }
```

Where another external call is in the function `convertFromSharesToAsset` and another nested one in EigenLayer function which is called!

Here is gas measured using your tests for default 2 assets, 3 assets and 13 assets.

> 2 assets
> Ran 30 tests for test/RioLRTCoordinator.t.sol:RioLRTCoordinatorTest
> [PASS] test_depositERC20() (gas: 217112)
> [PASS] test_requestERC20Withdrawal() (gas: 369153)

> 3 assets
> Ran 30 tests for test/RioLRTCoordinator.t.sol:RioLRTCoordinatorTest
> [PASS] test_depositERC20() (gas: 252326)
> [PASS] test_requestERC20Withdrawal() (gas: 412081)

> 13 assets gas
> Ran 30 tests for test/RioLRTCoordinator.t.sol:RioLRTCoordinatorTest
> [PASS] test_depositERC20() (gas: 604472)
> [PASS] test_requestERC20Withdrawal() (gas: 841373)

_The rest of the tests are skipped, because mainly deposit is affected_

With the current average gas price 70 gwei (around 3 PM CET, 28th Feb, 2024, https://etherscan.io/gastracker) if 13 assets are in the contract, which does not seem like many, the gas price will be computed in a following way (if tx does not fail out-of-gas):
`604472 * 70 / 10^9` * Eth price 3300$. The result is ~= 140$.

## Impact
Temporary DoS when new assets are added to the system

## Code Snippet
The following function for adding assets should have some limit.

## Tool used

Manual Review + upgraded foundry tests to see gas consumption

Tests upgrades:
- Create a few more assets and strategies in EigenLayerDeployer.sol
- Add created asset configs to the `assets` list in `RioDeployer.sol::issueRestakedLST`

## Recommendation

Limit the number of assets in the system or reconsider architecture with too many external calls
