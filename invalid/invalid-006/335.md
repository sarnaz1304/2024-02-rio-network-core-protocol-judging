# Unhandled chainlink revert would lock all price oracle access

## Summary
chainlink revert

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink's multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will. Therefore, to prevent denial of service scenarios, it is recommended to query Chainlink price feeds using a defensive approach with Solidityâ€™s try/catch structure. In this way, if the call to the price feed fails, the caller contract is still in control and can handle any errors safely and explicitly.

## Impact
Call to `latestRoundData` could potentially revert and make it impossible to query any prices. Feeds cannot be changed after they are configured ,funds can get locked

## Tool used

Manual Review ,vim

## Recommendation

Surround the call to `latestRoundData()` with `try/catch`  instead of calling it directly. In a scenario where the call reverts, the catch block can be used to call a fallback oracle or handle the error in any other suitable way.
