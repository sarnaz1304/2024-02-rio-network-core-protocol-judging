# M1 - DoS for getting price when oracle is abandoned

## Summary
getPrice will make the whole transaction revert when price oracle is abandoned by chainlink. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink oracles can be abandoned due to misbehavior.
In that case , any call to getting the price from that oracle might fail.
Currently , due to lack of calling getPrice try catch block to handle the failure case gracefully , entire transaction will fail.

```solidity
   function getPrice() external view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainlinkAggregatorV3(source).latestRoundData();
        if (block.timestamp > updatedAt + stalePriceDelay) revert STALE_PRICE();
        if (price <= 0) revert BAD_PRICE();

        return uint256(price);
    }
```

## Impact
DoS of every transaction involving getting price from ChainlinkPriceFeed.sol#getPrice method.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the getPrice in try catch block and gracefully handle the failure case and not making the whole transaction revert.
Another potential solution is to have a second, backup oracle for price like Uniswap v3 ( that has it's own limitations but you should consider discussing it with the team )
