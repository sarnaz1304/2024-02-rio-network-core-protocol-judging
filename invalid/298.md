# ChainlinkPriceFeed.stalePriceDelay assumes that all price delay of all asset feeds are the same.

## Summary

Since different feeds have different heartbeat, the usage of a singular price delay will render the heartbeat check ineffective for some feeds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol allows more than one asset to be used. Assuming the usage of non-ETH assets, there are pricefeeds that have varying price delay, from 1 hour to 1 day.

```solidity
    function getPrice() external view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainlinkAggregatorV3(source).latestRoundData();
        if (block.timestamp > updatedAt + stalePriceDelay) revert STALE_PRICE();
        if (price <= 0) revert BAD_PRICE();


        return uint256(price);
```

For example, AAVE/USD has a heartbeat of 1 hour whereas 1INCH has a heartbeat of 24 hours.

1INCH: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/1inch-usd

Depending on what `stalePriceDelay` is set as, the freshness validation would be useless for some pairs which will return stale data.

Also, the `stalePriceDelay` variable cannot be changed after being set. If the heartbeat of the different accepted assets is changed on Chainlink side, then the `stalePriceDelay` needs to be changed as well

## Impact

The stale check is inadequate. Stale data can be returned.

## Recommendation

Ensure that all price feed used has the same heartbeat. Also, make sure the `stalePriceDelay` variable is changeable.
