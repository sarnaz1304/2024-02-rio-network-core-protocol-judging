# Chainlink `oracle` can lead to wrong price `calculation` & loss of token

## Summary
`RioLRTAssetRegistry::getPrice()` fetches prices from the Chainlink contracts. But the price feeds has a very long `heartbeat` and `deviation` rate which might lead to wrong price calculation.

## Vulnerability Detail
`rETH/ETH`, `cbETH/ETH` have deviation of -2% to 2% and heartbeat of 86400s(very high) which means price of `rETH/ETH`, `cbETH/ETH` will be updated only after there is `deviation` of 2% or after 86400s and this creates issue as:-
1. if price go up by 1.5 %, it will not be `updated` as it is within 2% limit, so LRT will be minted based of less price, leading to less `LRTtoken` to staker
2. Similarly, if price go down by 1.5 %, it will not be `updated` as it is within 2% limit, so LRT will be minted based of more price, leading to more `LRTtoken` to staker, this will harm protocol
```solidity
   function convertToUnitOfAccountFromAsset(address asset, uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
        if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) {
            return amount;
        }
        address priceFeed = assetInfo[asset].priceFeed;
      @>  uint256 price = getPrice(priceFeed);

        return _normalizeDecimals(price * amount / priceScale, assetInfo[asset].decimals, priceFeedDecimals);
    }
```
```solidity
    function getPrice(address priceFeed) public view returns (uint256) {
        if (priceFeed == address(0)) {
            revert INVALID_PRICE_FEED();
        }
        return IPriceFeed(priceFeed).getPrice();
    }
```

## Recommendation
Use multiple oracles and average them or use feeds with less deviations and heartbeat
