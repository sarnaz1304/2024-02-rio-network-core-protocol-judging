# Usage of `rETH/ETH` oracle can lead to an incorrect amount of `reETH` minted due to the oracle's large deviation threshold and heartbeat

## Summary

Usage of `rETH/ETH` oracle can lead to an incorrect amount of `reETH` minted due to the oracle's large deviation threshold and heartbeat.

## Vulnerability Detail

When users want to `deposit` and mint `reETH`, the protocol calls `convertFromAssetToRestakingTokens` which in turn uses an Asset/ETH oracle to calculate how much `reETH` is supposed to be minted.

The protocol integrates Eigenlayer, which currently supports stETH, rETH and cbETH.

The problem arises when a user tries to deposit `rETH` to the protocol:

The user calls `deposit`, then `convertFromAssetToRestakingTokens` is called which calls `getPrice` from the `IPriceFeed` interface, which is an external oracle used to determine how many tokens to mint:

```solidity
    /// @notice Deposits ERC20 tokens and mints restaking token(s) to the caller.
    /// @param asset The asset being deposited.
    /// @param amountIn The amount of the asset being deposited.
    function deposit(address asset, uint256 amountIn) external checkDeposit(asset, amountIn) returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        // Convert deposited asset amount to restaking tokens.
        amountOut = convertFromAssetToRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn);

        // Pull tokens from the sender to the deposit pool.
        IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(depositPool()), amountIn);

        // Mint restaking tokens to the caller.
        token.mint(msg.sender, amountOut);

        emit Deposited(msg.sender, asset, amountIn, amountOut);
    }
```

```solidity
    /// @notice Converts an asset amount to its equivalent value in restaking tokens.

        uint256 value = assetRegistry().convertToUnitOfAccountFromAsset(asset, amount);
        return convertFromUnitOfAccountToRestakingTokens(value);
    }
```

```solidity
    /// @notice Converts an asset amount to its equivalent value in the unit of account. The unit of
    /// account is the price feed's quote asset.
    /// @param asset The address of the asset to convert.
    /// @param amount The amount of the asset to convert.
    function convertToUnitOfAccountFromAsset(address asset, uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
        if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) {
            return amount;
        }
        address priceFeed = assetInfo[asset].priceFeed;
        uint256 price = getPrice(priceFeed);

        return _normalizeDecimals(price * amount / priceScale, assetInfo[asset].decimals, priceFeedDecimals);
    }
```

As you can see we use an oracle to get the price, which is used to calculate `amountOut` of `reETH` tokens to mint to the user.

The problem arises when a user tries to deposit `rETH` to the protocol because the `rETH/ETH` oracle [has a large deviation threshold of 2% and a heartbeat of 24 hours](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/reth-eth).
The price can move up or down, up to 2% in 24 hours, before a price update is triggered from the oracle.
The result is that the on-chain price will be quite different compared to the true price of `rETH`, which in turn will lead to an incorrect amount of `rETH` minted to the user.

## Impact

Since the price can move both up or down, this can either lead to a loss of funds for the user if the price moves down, since he'll be minted less `rETH`, or a loss for the protocol if the price moves up, because the user will be minted more `rETH`.

## Recommendation

Use custom-configured TWAP oracles instead.
