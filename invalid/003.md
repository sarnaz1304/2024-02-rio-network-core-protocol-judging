# Potential DOS in contracts inheriting UUPSUpgradable

## Summary
There are a number of contracts which inherit UUPSUpgradeable.sol, namely; RioLRT.sol, RioLRTCore.sol, RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol, RioLRTCoordinator.sol and RioLRTDepositPool.sol, RioLRTIssuer.sol, RioLRTOperatorDelegator.sol, RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol, RioLRTRewardDistributor.sol and RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol

If the implementation contract is left uninitialized, it is possible for any user to gain ownership of the onlyOwner role in the implementation contract for RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol, RioLRTCoordinator.sol and RioLRTDepositPool.sol, RioLRTIssuer.sol, RioLRTOperatorRegistry.sol, RioLRTRewardDistributor.sol and RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol. Once the user has ownership they are able to perform an upgrade of the implementation contract's logic contract and delegate call into any arbitrary contract, allowing them to self-destruct the proxy's implementation contract. Consequently, this will prevent all vulnerable contract interactions until a new implementation contract is deployed.

## Vulnerability Detail
Initial information about this issue was found [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/proxy#Initializable).

## Impact
Consider the following scenario:
    Specifically the contract in question is RioLRTIssuer.sol.

    The RioLRTIssuer leave the implementation contracts uninitialized.

    This allows any arbitrary user to call initialize() on the RioLRTIssuer.sol implementation contract.

    Once a user has gained control over RioLRTIssuer.sol's implementation contract, they can call `issueLRT` and initialize all the other contracts.

    Now the protocol has deploy a new implementation contract before it can be used.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the same initializer logic as used in `RioLRT` contract. Where during deployment an  `issuer` is set that can initialze the contracts. This will help to ensure the implementation contract cannot be self-destructed.
