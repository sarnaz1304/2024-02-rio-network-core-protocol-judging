# Removing an asset doesn't clear its associated utilization heap

## Summary
Removing an asset doesn't clear its associated utilization heap

## Vulnerability Detail
When an asset is removed its associated utilization heap is not cleared

```solidity
    function removeAsset(address asset) external onlyOwner {
        if (!isSupportedAsset(asset)) revert ASSET_NOT_SUPPORTED(asset);
        if (getTVLForAsset(asset) > 0) revert ASSET_HAS_BALANCE();

        uint256 assetCount = supportedAssets.length;
        uint256 assetIndex = _findAssetIndex(asset);

        supportedAssets[assetIndex] = supportedAssets[assetCount - 1];
        supportedAssets.pop();

        delete assetInfo[asset];

        emit AssetRemoved(asset);
    }
```

If this asset is added again, the deposits will be allocated according to the previously stored utilization heap which can contain now inactive operators. This can lead to misuse of the funds since the operator is no longer associated with the rio network

## Impact
If an asset is removed and added again, it can cause the funds to be allocated to inactive operators who may act maliciously leading to possible loss of funds

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Clear the utilization heap of the asset when removing the asset
