# getPrice() does not implement incomplete round check & minAnswer/maxAnswer limit

## Summary
The ChainlinkPriceFeed.sol::getPrice() does not implement the check for incomplete round.
## Vulnerability Detail
Users of the protocol may use incorrect outdated price if the chainlink starts a new round and struggles to establish consensus on the new value for the oracle.
The latestRoundData() returns following things and protocol should use all of this to stay updated and protected:
```solidity
(
            uint80 roundID ,
            int answer,
            uint startedAt,
            uint timeStamp,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = dataFeed.latestRoundData();
```
Put a check for incomplete round: 
```solidity
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Price stale");
```
Also it is recommended by Chainlink to [check the latest answer against reasonable limits](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits). For monitoring purposes, you must decide what limits are acceptable for your application.
Put a check like this:
```solidity
require(answer < maxAnswer && answer > minAnswer, " Price not acceptable");
```
## Impact
Users may get incorrect data.
