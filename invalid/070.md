# Potential Temporary Freezing of Funds Due to Lack of Individual Staking Error Handling in stakeETH Function

## Summary
The **stakeETH** function in the smart contract contains a vulnerability where if the **eigenPodManager.stake** function call fails for any reason during the processing of multiple validators, the entire transaction reverts, leading to a temporary freezing of all ETH funds sent with the transaction. This vulnerability arises due to the lack of proper error handling around the **eigenPodManager.stake** call within the loop over **validatorCount**, which means any single failure during this loop will cause all subsequent staking operations to fail and the transaction to revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Potential Temporary Freezing of Funds Due to Lack of Individual Staking Error Handling in stakeETH Function" in the provided code is that the stakeETH function does not have individual error handling for each staking operation within the loop. This means that if an error occurs during the staking process for a specific validator within the loop, the entire function will revert and all funds sent with the transaction will be temporarily frozen.

Specifically, if an error occurs during the staking of a validator in the loop (for example, due to an invalid public key or signature), the function will revert and all funds sent with the transaction will be reverted as well. This can lead to a situation where valid validators are not staked due to the failure of a single validator, causing a temporary freezing of funds until the issue is resolved.
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could provide a batch of validators with one or more validators that would trigger an error during the staking process. This could be due to various reasons such as invalid public keys or signatures.

Here is a Proof of Concept (PoC) code to demonstrate the exploitation of this vulnerability:

1. Attacker prepares a batch of validators with one invalid validator:

```solidity
validatorCount = 2
pubkeyBatch = [valid_pubkey, invalid_pubkey]
signatureBatch = [valid_signature, valid_signature]

```
2. Attacker calls the stakeETH function with the prepared batch:

```solidity
stakeETH(validatorCount, pubkeyBatch, signatureBatch)
```
3. The staking process will fail for the invalid validator, but the funds for both validators will be frozen temporarily due to the lack of individual error handling.

This exploit allows the attacker to temporarily freeze the funds for all validators in the batch by including just one invalid validator.
## Impact
The maximum achievable impact of the root cause is the potential loss of availability of staked ETH until the issue that caused the failure is resolved and the transaction can be successfully resubmitted and mined."

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, individual error handling should be implemented within the loop so that if an error occurs during the staking process for a specific validator, the transaction is reverted and the funds are not frozen.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to include individual error handling:

```solidity
186       function stakeETH(uint256 validatorCount, bytes calldata pubkeyBatch, bytes calldata signatureBatch) external payable onlyDepositPool {
187           if (validatorCount == 0 || msg.value / ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE != validatorCount) revert INVALID_VALIDATOR_COUNT();
188           if (pubkeyBatch.length != BLS_PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH * validatorCount) {
189               revert INVALID_PUBLIC_KEYS_BATCH_LENGTH(pubkeyBatch.length, BLS_PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH * validatorCount);
190           }
191           if (signatureBatch.length != BLS_SIGNATURE_LENGTH * validatorCount) {
192               revert INVALID_SIGNATURES_BATCH_LENGTH(signatureBatch.length, BLS_SIGNATURE_LENGTH * validatorCount);
193           }
194   
195           bytes32 depositDataRoot;
196           bytes32 withdrawalCredentials_ = withdrawalCredentials;
197           bytes memory publicKey = Memory.unsafeAllocateBytes(BLS_PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH);
198           bytes memory signature = Memory.unsafeAllocateBytes(BLS_SIGNATURE_LENGTH);
199           for (uint256 i = 0; i < validatorCount; ++i) {
200               Memory.copyBytes(pubkeyBatch, publicKey, i * BLS_PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH, 0, BLS_PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH);
201               Memory.copyBytes(signatureBatch, signature, i * BLS_SIGNATURE_LENGTH, 0, BLS_SIGNATURE_LENGTH);
202               depositDataRoot = _computeDepositDataRoot(withdrawalCredentials_, publicKey, signature);
203   
204               try eigenPodManager.stake{value: ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE}(publicKey, signature, depositDataRoot) {
205                   // Success, do nothing
206               } catch {
207                   revert STAKING_ERROR(i);
208               }
209           }
210       }
```
In this patched code, a **try-catch** block is added around the stake transaction for each validator. If an error occurs during the staking process for a specific validator, the transaction will be reverted with a specific error message indicating which validator caused the issue. This ensures that funds are not frozen due to errors during the staking process.
