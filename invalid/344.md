# Malicious users can steal tokens from Oracles by crafting and submitting specific requests.

## Summary
When the owner of the Oracle fulfils a request, it performs an external call is made which is intended to
supply the off-chain data to the calling contract. The current implementation is such that a user can manufacture
any arbitrary address that the Oracle will call when fulfilling a request, along with any function signature and
initial parameter. Thus a user can craft a malicious request to the Link token contract, which when fulfilled, will
transfer Link tokens from the Oracle to the attacker.

## Vulnerability Detail
s a user can craft a malicious request to the Link token contract

## Impact

attacker can steal funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The least restrictive is to blacklist addresses that `callback.addr` can take. For example, adding a require statement that ensures callback.addr is not the Link token address would be one approach.or  only allow callback addresses from the contracts that created the request.
