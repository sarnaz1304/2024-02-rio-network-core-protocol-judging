# [M-2] - `OperatorUtilizationHeap::remove` function may not do what is expected

## Summary
`OperatorUtilizationHeap::remove` may not remove an operator from the heap
## Vulnerability Detail
in the `OperatorUtilizationHeap::remove` function is called `_remove` function with the following code:
```javascript
function _remove(Data memory self, uint8 i) internal pure {
        self.operators[i] = self.operators[self.count--];
    }
```
Which purpose is to remove an operator from the heap, but it wont do so.
## Impact
There are two edge cases:
1. The operator we want to remove is in the last index of the `operators[]` array:
    - In this case the operator wont be removed, because he is the `self.operators[i]` and `self.operators[self.count--]` will be the same thing
2. The operator we want to remove is in any other index of the `operators[]` array:
    - Then the record of this operator will be removed, but the last record in the array will be in two different places in the same array

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add the following line of code to the `_remove()` function:
```javascript
delete self.operators[self.count--];
```
