# Attacker can frontrun coordinator.deposit(...) to break minting of LRTs and steal depositors funds

## Summary
In order to prevent inflation attack when a new LRT is issued using `RioLRTIssuer.issueLRT(...)`, a sacrificial deposit is made to prevent inflation attacks. Because the call to the coordinator.deposit(...) function is external, an attacker can frontrun the `coordinator.deposit(...)` function to inflate TVL and ensure the issuer receives zero shares. 
Note that anyone can deposit into the `RioLRTDepositPool.sol` contract and this will contribute to increasing the TVL which is a critical variable in the calculation of shares received and shares owed during deposit and withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Attacker front runs `RioLRTCoordinator.deposit(...)` with at least 1 wei to receive equivalent shares. The attacker can use 1 wei because the [`checkDeposit(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTCoordinator.sol#L31-L36) modifier only checks if the asset amount is greater than 0.
- Attacker immediately transfers huge amount of asset to RioLRTDepositPool.sol contract to inflate TVL
- `issuer's` initial deposit call goes through but receives zero shares of the LRT
- subsequent depositors also receive zero LRTs
- Attacker calls `RioLRTCoordinator.requestWithdrawal(...)` to withdraw asset while there is enough asset in the deposit pool to settle his withdrawal.
- Attacker is settled from the deposit pool since it currently holds all the TVL and it can settle the requested withdrawal in the epoch in which the withdrawal is requested.
- Other depositors try to withdraw but get noting in return since they did not get any LRT shares when they made their initial deposits

## Impact
This can lead to loss of funds for users since they will receive zero shares of LRTs for their deposit and as such their deposit will be stuck in the contract

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the `RioLRTCoordinator.sol` contract, modify the `deposit(...)` function as shown below such that if the 

`token.totalSupply() == 0 && msg.sender != issuer` the `RioLRTCoordinator.deposit(...)` should revert

```solidity
    function deposit(address asset, uint256 amountIn) external checkDeposit(asset, amountIn) returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        
+        if (token.totalSupply() == 0 && msg.sender != issuer) revert();

        // Convert deposited asset amount to restaking tokens.
        amountOut = convertFromAssetToRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn);

        // Pull tokens from the sender to the deposit pool.
        IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(depositPool()), amountIn);

        // Mint restaking tokens to the caller.
        // @audit POC compare the amount of LRT the user gets with the amount they put in
        token.mint(msg.sender, amountOut);

        emit Deposited(msg.sender, asset, amountIn, amountOut);
    }
```
