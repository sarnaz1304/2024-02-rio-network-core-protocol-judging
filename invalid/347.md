# The amount of time an asset price is considered stale is fixed.

## Summary
In ChainLinkPriceFeed.sol, The stalePriceDelay variable reflects the amount of time an asset price is considered stale. However, this variable cannot be changed once the ChainLinkPriceFeed contract is deployed.
As a result, if the price is not updated for a certain period of time in ChainLink, the protocol may be stopped.
## Vulnerability Detail
The stalePriceDelay variable is initialized in ChainLinkPriceFeed.sol#constructor().

```solidity
    /// @param source_ The address of the price feed source (Chainlink Aggregator).
    /// @param stalePriceDelay_ The amount of time after which an asset price is considered stale.
    constructor(address source_, uint256 stalePriceDelay_) {
        source = source_;
27      stalePriceDelay = stalePriceDelay_;

        decimals = IChainlinkAggregatorV3(source_).decimals();
        description = IChainlinkAggregatorV3(source_).description();
    }
```

As shown above, once this contract is deplyed, the _stalePriceDelay variable cannot be changed.
However If the real-world price of an asset deviates past some interval, ChainLink will trigger all the nodes to do an update. Right now, most Ethereum data feeds have a 0.5% deviation threshold.
In scenarios where the market price remains unchanged over a period, If the price does not meet the deviation threshold for updates, and the time since the last update does not exceed the configured minimum interval, Chainlink might not update the feed. This behavior is intentional, optimizing for network and cost efficiency.
That is, if the deviation between the current time and the time the price was last updated exceeds the time when the asset price is considered stale, the getPrice() function is always reverted.

```solidity
    function getPrice() external view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainlinkAggregatorV3(source).latestRoundData();
36      if (block.timestamp > updatedAt + stalePriceDelay) revert STALE_PRICE();
        if (price <= 0) revert BAD_PRICE();

        return uint256(price);
    }
```

As a result, the protocol may be stopped.
## Impact
The price of the asset cannot be obtained and the protocol cannot mint restaking tokens or request withdrawal to asset for restaking tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the setStalePriceDelay() function to the ChainLinkPriceFeed contract.

```solidity
    function setStalePriceDelay(uint256 stalePriceDelay_) onlyOwner {
        require(stalePriceDelay_>0);
        stalePriceDelay=stalePriceDelay_;
    }
```
