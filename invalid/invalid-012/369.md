# Share's Precision not reduced to nearest GWEI if asset is ETH

## Summary
Share's Precision not reduced to nearest GWEI if asset is ETH 

## Vulnerability Detail
Here in RioLRTDepositPool.sol [transferMaxAssetsForShares()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTDepositPool.sol#L76-L96) function when requested shares <= total shares in pool and asset is ETH then before sending asset assetSent's precision not reduced to nearest GWEI.

## Impact
If precision is not reduced to the nearest GWEI then it will revert as this is the smallest unit of account supported by EigenLayer.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before sending asset reduce precision to nearest GWEI 
`assetSent = assetSent.reducePrecisionToGwei();`
