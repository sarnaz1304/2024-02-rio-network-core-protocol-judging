# Relying solely on the ChainLink oracle for asset prices may not always provide accurate prices.

## Summary
Using only the ChainLink oracle may not accurately reflect market conditions, and this may have a negative impact on the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
The Rio network only uses ChainLink oracles to obtain asset prices.
the asset price is an important factor in minting a restaking token or requesting withdrawal of an asset corresponding to a restaking token.
However, cryptocurrency and other financial markets are highly volatile. Prices can change rapidly within seconds, especially during periods of high trading volume or market-moving news events. This volatility means that the price provided by Chainlink at any given moment might slightly lag behind the real-time market price due to the inherent latency in gathering, aggregating, and disseminating data.
Also ChainLink may not reflect accurate prices due to various factors like Data Aggregation,Update Frequency,Differences Across Exchanges and so on.
As a result,this may have a negative impact on the protocol.
## Impact
Since the asset price is not obtained accurately, the protocol or the user may lose the asset.
