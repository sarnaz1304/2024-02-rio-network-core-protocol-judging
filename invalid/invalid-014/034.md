# Wrong Deposit Amount Returned After Ether Deposit to Operators

## Summary
Wrong deposit Amount Returned After Ether Deposit to Operators in depositETHToOperators(...) function in the OperatorOperations.sol contract
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function depositETHToOperators(IRioLRTOperatorRegistry operatorRegistry, uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256 depositAmount) {
        uint256 depositCount = amount / ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE;
        if (depositCount == 0) return depositAmount;

        // forgefmt: disable-next-item
        (uint256 depositsAllocated, IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorETHAllocation[] memory allocations) = operatorRegistry.allocateETHDeposits(
            depositCount
        );
>>>        depositAmount = depositsAllocated * ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < allocations.length; ++i) {
            uint256 deposits = allocations[i].deposits;

>>>            IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(allocations[i].delegator).stakeETH{value: deposits * ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE}(
                deposits, allocations[i].pubKeyBatch, allocations[i].signatureBatch
            );
        }
    }
```
In other to simplify this report as much as possible understanding the function provided above is important, the functions shows how deposit is made to operators in the depositETHToOperators(...) function, it can be noted  that `uint256 depositAmount` is returned after the functions implementation which is meant to represent the overall amount that was deposited to the operators. At the latter part of the function DepositAmount was assigned the value of depositsAllocated  from operatorRegistry.allocateETHDeposits(...) function call instead of using the actual deposit that was sent to the operators as noted from the last pointer in the code above, this is not totally correct as there is no guarantee depositsAllocated will always be equal the deposit that was actually made, due to several factors such as precision lose, math error etc. , The actual Deposits should be returned not the Allocated Deposit

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
depositAmount should be assigned directly to the value that is being deposited as the deposit is taking place , to ensure the value that is actually being returned is the value of deposit that was indeed made
