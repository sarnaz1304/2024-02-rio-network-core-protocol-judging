# Excess Ether will be Lost to withdrawal queue due to Wrong implementation in OperatorOperations Contract

## Summary
Excess Ether will be Lost to withdrawal queue due to Wrong implementation in queueETHWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement((...) function in OperatorOperations Contract
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function queueETHWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(IRioLRTOperatorRegistry operatorRegistry, uint256 amount) internal returns (bytes32 aggregateRoot) {
        ...
>>>            // Ensure we do not send more than needed to the withdrawal queue. The remaining will stay in the Eigen Pod.
>>>            uint256 amountToWithdraw = (i == length - 1) ? remainingAmount : operatorDepositDeallocations[i].deposits * ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE;
      remainingAmount -= amountToWithdraw;
            roots[i] = IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(delegator).queueWithdrawalForUserSettlement(BEACON_CHAIN_STRATEGY, amountToWithdraw);
        }
        aggregateRoot = keccak256(abi.encode(roots));
    }
```
The code above shows how queueETHWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement(...) function is implemented in the OperatorOperations.sol contract, the point of interest is the comment description from the pointer above, it clearly states that more than needed is not sent to the withdrawal queue and the remaining should remain in the Eigen Pod. However that is not the case as the implementation shows that the remainingAmount is sent with the last Operator i.e when (i == length - 1),  which represents the last index, every ether left is sent with the "remainingAmount" variable at the last loop which is against expected protocol implementation
## Impact
Excess Ether will be Lost to withdrawal queue due to Wrong implementation in queueETHWithdrawalFromOperatorsForUserSettlement((...) function in OperatorOperations Contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
RIO Protocol should add necessary function or implementation to handle the excess Ether to ensure it is not lost to withdrawal queue instead it should remain in the Eigen Pod as noted from the comment description
