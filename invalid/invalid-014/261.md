# Overflow on shift operations


## Summary

By addressing the arithmetic overflow issue in the shifting operations within the memcpy function used by the copyBytes function, potential vulnerabilities related to memory corruption and unintended behavior have been mitigated in the RioLRTOperatorDelegator contract. This fix ensures accurate and secure copying of data, reducing the risk of memory corruption, unauthorized access, and manipulation of contract state, thereby enhancing the overall security and reliability of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The original memcpy function was designed to copy bytes of memory from a source to a destination. For any leftover bytes less than 32, it attempted to construct a mask to preserve unaffected bytes in the destination while updating the rest from the source. However, the calculation of the mask using let mask := sub(shl(mul(8, sub(32, len)), 1), 1) was flawed. This expression did not correctly compute the intended mask, leading to potential memory corruption.

The incorrect mask calculation could allow parts of the memory not meant to be overwritten to change, impacting the contract's state integrity or leading to leakage of sensitive information between unrelated parts of the contract or even between different contracts.
Resolution

The memcpy function was revised with a correct mask calculation: let mask := sub(shl(1, sub(mul(8, 32), len)), 1). This corrected expression properly computes the mask to ensure that only the intended bytes are overwritten during the copy operation of less than 32 bytes, preserving the rest of the destination memory as intended.

The fix addresses the risk of unintended data alteration and ensures the reliability of memory operations within the contract, safeguarding contract state integrity and preventing potential information leakage.
Implications of the Fix

The corrected implementation of the memcpy function ensures accurate and safe copying of memory segments of arbitrary lengths within the smart contract. This fix is crucial for contracts that perform complex memory operations, including those that handle sensitive data or require precise manipulation of storage for functionality such as token transfers, voting mechanisms, or any logic that relies on byte-level data processing.

By resolving this vulnerability, contract developers can trust the Memory library to perform memory operations securely and predictably, thereby reducing the surface for potential attacks or bugs resulting from improper memory handling.
## Impact
    Data Integrity Violation: The primary impact is the potential for data integrity violation. If the memcpy function is used to copy critical data (e.g., account balances, contract states), the incorrect mask may lead to overwriting unintended memory areas or incorrect data being copied. This compromises the integrity of stored data, leading to states that do not reflect the actual intentions of the contract's operations.

    Security Vulnerabilities: Malicious actors could exploit the flawed memcpy logic to craft specific inputs that manipulate the contract's state in unintended ways. For instance, if the function is used in security-sensitive contexts like access control or transaction validation, it might be possible to bypass checks or induce unauthorized state changes.

    Functional Bugs and Unpredictable Behavior: Contracts relying on precise memory operations would experience bugs and unpredictable behavior. This could manifest in functionalities not working as intended, loss of funds due to incorrect transaction processing, or even contracts getting stuck due to irrecoverable states.

    Reputation and Financial Loss: For projects and entities using contracts with this vulnerability, the impacts extend beyond technical failures. Reputation damage due to security flaws and functional bugs can lead to loss of user trust and financial loss, both from rectifying the issues and potential exploitation.

https://github.com/viktor81562/audits/blob/f1bce2d2096ec4e8a8f0345baa2e037f7764dbe3/memcpy.sol#L39

```sol
function memcpy(uint256 src, uint256 dst, uint256 len) internal pure {
        assembly {
            // While at least 32 bytes left, copy in 32-byte chunks.
            for {} gt(len, 31) {} {
                mstore(dst, mload(src))
                src := add(src, 32)
                dst := add(dst, 32)
                len := sub(len, 32)
            }
            if gt(len, 0) {
                // Read the next 32-byte chunk from `dst` and replace the first N bytes
                // with those left in the `src`, and write the transformed chunk back.
                let mask := sub(shl(1, sub(mul(8, 32), len)), 1) // (1 << (8 * 32)) - (1 << len)
                // Changed from "let mask := sub(shl(mul(8, sub(32, len)), 1), 1) // 2 ** (8 * (32 - len)) - 1"
                let srcMasked := and(mload(src), not(mask))
                let dstMasked := and(mload(dst), mask)
                mstore(dst, or(dstMasked, srcMasked))
            }
        }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use function implementation in that way to prevent undefined behavior or finance lost:

```sol
function memcpy(uint256 src, uint256 dst, uint256 len) internal pure {
        assembly {
            // While at least 32 bytes left, copy in 32-byte chunks.
            for {} gt(len, 31) {} {
                mstore(dst, mload(src))
                src := add(src, 32)
                dst := add(dst, 32)
                len := sub(len, 32)
            }
            if gt(len, 0) {
                // Read the next 32-byte chunk from `dst` and replace the first N bytes
                // with those left in the `src`, and write the transformed chunk back.
                let mask := sub(shl(1, sub(mul(8, 32), len)), 1) // (1 << (8 * 32)) - (1 << len)
                let srcMasked := and(mload(src), not(mask))
                let dstMasked := and(mload(dst), mask)
                mstore(dst, or(dstMasked, srcMasked))
            }
        }
    }
