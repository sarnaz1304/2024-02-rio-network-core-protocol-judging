# If any operator is deactivated then adding more operators is not possible

## Summary
The owner of the operator registry can add/activate/deactivate new operators. However, if an operator is deactivated for good, then new operator can not be assigned due to operatorId collision. 
## Vulnerability Detail
An operator can be deactivated by the owner by calling the `deactivateOperator` function as follows:
```solidity
function deactivateOperator(
        RioLRTOperatorRegistryStorageV1.StorageV1 storage s,
        IRioLRTAssetRegistry assetRegistry,
        uint8 operatorId
    ) external {
        .
        .
        operator.active = false;
        // @review active operator count is decremented by 1
        -> s.activeOperatorCount -= 1;
    } 
```

Then, owner can also add any operator by calling `addOperator` function as follows:
```solidity
function addOperator(
        RioLRTOperatorRegistryStorageV1.StorageV1 storage s,
        address token,
        address operatorDelegatorBeacon,
        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorConfig memory config
    ) external returns (uint8 operatorId, address delegator) {
        .
        operatorId = ++s.operatorCount;
        // @review overrides the last operator! 
        -> s.activeOperatorCount += 1;

        // Create the operator with the provided salt and initialize it.
        // @review will revert because the address is already deployed before with the same operatorID before!
        -> delegator = CREATE3.deploy(
            computeOperatorSalt(operatorId),
            abi.encodePacked(type(BeaconProxy).creationCode, abi.encode(operatorDelegatorBeacon, '')),
            0
        );
        IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(delegator).initialize(token, config.operator);
        .
        .
    }
```

Since the operator id used to deploy the new set of delegator contract, the address will be existed hence, the function will revert. Consequently, adding new operators when there is a deactivated operator is impossible. 

**Coded PoC:**
```solidity
function test_deactivatedOperatorBlocks_NewOperators_ToBeAdded() public {
        uint8 operatorId = addOperatorDelegator(reETH.operatorRegistry, address(reETH.rewardDistributor));
        reETH.operatorRegistry.deactivateOperator(operatorId);
         
        vm.expectRevert();
        operatorId = addOperatorDelegator(reETH.operatorRegistry, address(reETH.rewardDistributor));
    }
```
## Impact
When there is a deactivated operator no new operators can be added. If the operator deactivated is deactivated for good, then this becomes more of an issue. Because that would basically mean if an operator is deactivated then new operators can never be added! Considering this I will label this as high

## Recommendation
Add a function to remove the operator separately or change the operatorCount logic inside the add/activate/deactivate
