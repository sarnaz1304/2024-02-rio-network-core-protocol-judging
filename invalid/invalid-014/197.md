# RioLRT voting quorum and power will unfairly fluctuate due to withdrawal process

## Summary

RioLRT inherits from ERC20VotesUpgradeable making RioLRT a voting token. When LRT token holders withdrawal their assets from a RioLRT network, the LRT tokens are immediately transferred to the WithdrawalQueue. This can greatly influence the ability to reach quorum at any given time and make any voting initiatives difficult to fairly implement.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user calls RioLRTCoordinator.requestWithdrawal(), LRT tokens are transferred to the Withdrawal Queue contract. LRT tokens act as voting tokens. As soon as these tokens are transferred to the WithdrawalQueue, they are no longer accessible for voting. This makes the number of available votes to vote on an initiative more difficult to reach.

Let's take a look at RioLRTCoordinator.requestWithdrawal() to understand LRT tokens are transferred to the WithdrawalQueue contract:

```solidity
function requestWithdrawal(address asset, uint256 amountIn) external checkWithdrawal(asset, amountIn) returns (uint256 sharesOwed) {
    // Determine the amount of shares owed to the withdrawer using the current exchange rate.
    sharesOwed = convertToSharesFromRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn);

    // If requesting ETH, reduce the precision of the shares owed to the nearest Gwei,
    // which is the smallest unit of account supported by EigenLayer.
    if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) sharesOwed = sharesOwed.reducePrecisionToGwei();

    // Pull restaking tokens from the sender to the withdrawal queue.
    // AUDIT: here the 
    token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(withdrawalQueue()), amountIn);
    ... 
}
```

Now that we know that LRT tokens are transferred to the Withdrawal Queue contract, let's play out the following scenario:

- 1500 votes (aka LRT tokens) currently exist
- 1000 votes are required to reach quorum for a proposal that is submitted in Block 2

```markdown
Block 1
- 700 LRT tokens are queued for withdrawal via RioLRTCoordinator.requestWithdrawal(). This makes a total of 800 votes available to be voted on. WithdrawalQueue can't vote.

Block 2
- Proposal is made requiring 2/3 vote.
- 800 LRT tokens are used to vote on the proposal.

Block 3
- Proposal fails as it only has 700 out of the 1000 required votes.
```

In the above scenario, we see that quorum can never be reached for the proposal since 700 of the votes are moved to the WithdrawalQueue contract.



## Impact

By transferring votes (LRTokens) at the time of requesting a withdrawal, the following actions will occur:

- The ability to reach quorum will become more difficult as these transferred LRT tokens are dead in the water and will artificially keep the total voting power higher than it should be.
- The RioLRTWithdrawalQueue contract has no ability to vote on any governance proposals, leading to more consensus required to reach quorum.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Protocol should delegate stakers voting rights to stakers until LRT tokens are burned. When the tokens are burned, the delegation can be reduced by the pro-rata amount for all stakers who have sent LRT tokens to the Withdrawal Queue contract.
