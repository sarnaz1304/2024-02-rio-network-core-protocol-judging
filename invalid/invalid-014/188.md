# Asset can't be deposited to its full `depositCap` limit as it also includes received rewards while checking

## Summary
Asset can't be deposited to its full `depositCap` limit as `reward` received from `RioLRTRewardDistributor` is also getting included while checking  for depositCap limit in `RioLRTCoordinator:: _checkDepositCapReached()`

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user `deposits asset` to Rio then it checks whether overall deposit of that asset is below `depositCap` limit or not, and for that it checks asset present in `depositPool` as well as in `EigenLayer`.
```solidity
    function _checkDepositCapReached(address asset, uint256 amountIn) internal view {
        IRioLRTAssetRegistry assetRegistry_ = assetRegistry();

        uint256 depositCap = assetRegistry_.getAssetDepositCap(asset);
        if (depositCap > 0) {
      @>      uint256 existingBalance = assetRegistry_.getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset);
            if (existingBalance + amountIn > depositCap) {
                revert DEPOSIT_CAP_REACHED(asset, depositCap);
            }
        }
    }
```
```solidity
  function getTotalBalanceForAsset(address asset) public view returns (uint256) {
        if (!isSupportedAsset(asset)) revert ASSET_NOT_SUPPORTED(asset);

        address depositPool_ = address(depositPool());
        if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) {
            return depositPool_.balance + getETHBalanceInEigenLayer();
        }

        uint256 sharesHeld = getAssetSharesHeld(asset);
        uint256 tokensInRio = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(depositPool_);
        uint256 tokensInEigenLayer = convertFromSharesToAsset(getAssetStrategy(asset), sharesHeld);

        return tokensInRio + tokensInEigenLayer;
    }
```
Now, `depositPool` receives asset from user as well as rewards from `RioLRTRewardDistributor` & the problem is this `reward` also gets included while checking for `depositCap`, preventing the full `utilization` of depositCap limit.
```solidity
   receive() external payable {
        uint256 value = msg.value;

        uint256 treasuryShare = value * treasuryETHValidatorRewardShareBPS / MAX_BPS;
        uint256 operatorShare = value * operatorETHValidatorRewardShareBPS / MAX_BPS;
        uint256 poolShare = value - treasuryShare - operatorShare;

        if (treasuryShare > 0) treasury.transferETH(treasuryShare);
        if (operatorShare > 0) operatorRewardPool.transferETH(operatorShare);
     @>   if (poolShare > 0) address(depositPool()).transferETH(poolShare);

        emit ETHValidatorRewardsDistributed(treasuryShare, operatorShare, poolShare);
    }
```
// Here is how this works
1. Eth has `depositCap` of 10 ether
2. User deposited 5 ether, now balance of depositPool is 5 ether(neglecting sacrificial deposit)
3. Other users should be able to deposit 5 ether to reach depositCap
4. Now, depositPool receives 2 ether as a reward from rewardDistributor
5. balance of depositPool became 7 ether
6. Next user can only deposit 3 ether as balance of depositPool is getting used while checking for `depositCapLimit`,


## Impact
Asset can't be deposited to its full depositCap limit

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Store separately amount of asset received as reward and subtract it while checking for depositCapLimit
