# RioLRTOperatorDelegator.stakeERC20() has no slippage checks

## Summary

Rio frequently deposits assets into Eigenlayer strategy contracts via rebalancing. This process is first initiated when RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance() is called. Eventually RioLRTOperatorDelegator.stakeERC20() is called which will deposit the assets into the Eigenlayer strategy. We can see that stack trace below:

- RioLRTCoordinator.rebalance
  -  RioLRTDepositPool.depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer
    - OperatorOperations.depositTokenToOperators
      - RioLRTOperatorDelegator.stakeERC20    
        - EigenLayer's StrategyManager.depositIntoStrategy()


Unfortunately, there are no slippage checks when calling EigenLayer's StrategyManager.depositIntoStrategy(). This results in the OperatorDelegator potentially receiving less EigenLayer shares tokens than they expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

When an OperatorDelegator stakes the strategy's underlying token into the EigenLayer strategy via stakeERC20(), slippage may occur due to the transaction either being frontrun or because other innocent users paying more gas to stake into the Eigenlayer strategy first. Below you can see the stakeERC20 which contains no slippage checks. 

```solidity
function stakeERC20(address strategy, address token_, uint256 amount) external onlyDepositPool returns (uint256 shares) {
    // AUDIT: no slippage checks
    if (IERC20(token_).allowance(address(this), address(strategyManager)) < amount) {
        IERC20(token_).forceApprove(address(strategyManager), type(uint256).max);
    }
    shares = strategyManager.depositIntoStrategy(strategy, token_, amount);
}
```

Looking further into OperatorOperations.depositTokenToOperators() we also see no additional slippage checks:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < allocations.length; ++i) {
    IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorStrategyAllocation memory allocation = allocations[i];

    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(allocation.delegator, allocation.tokens);
    sharesReceived += IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(allocation.delegator).stakeERC20(strategy, token, allocation.tokens);
}
// AUDIT: note that this is not a slippage check and instead relies on the current Eigenlayer state at the time of the transaction.
if (sharesReceived != sharesAllocated) revert INCORRECT_NUMBER_OF_SHARES_RECEIVED();
```
 
Please note that although OperatorOperations.depositTokenToOperators() is called and has a validation check [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorOperations.sol#L67), this check is not a slippage check as sharesAllocated is formulated from Eigenlayer's altered-slippage state. This check does not deal with Eigenlayer's strategy mint shares being slipped.


## Impact

Rio may receive less LRT tokens than expected. This will lead to Rio being exposed to front-running every time Rio rebalances it's system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a slippage check in the stakeERC20() function to check that the amount of shares received when calling strategyManager.depositIntoStrategy() are within a defined range.
