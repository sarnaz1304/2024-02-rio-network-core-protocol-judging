# `RioLRT` is non-compilance with the ERC-2612 Standard

## Summary

`RioLRT` ERC-20 token is a ERC-2612 permit upgradable standard contract, however does not implements the EIP's security standard such as `DOMAIN_SEPARATO` and `permit` functions, thus makes the token vulnerable to signature replay attacks and non-compilance with other services that strictly adheres to the `EIP-2612` standard.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract [RioLRT.sol](rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRT.sol) implements the EIP-2612 standard via [OpenZeppelin's ERC20PermitUpgradeable](), but the implementation is incorrect. According to the standard described in [ERC-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) the contract must implement the function `function DOMAIN_SEPARATOR() external view returns (bytes32)` alongside `function permit(address owner, address spender, uint value, uint deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external`. However, `RioLRT` ERC-20 contract doesn't implement above mentioned functions, which makes it non-compilance with the security standard.

The `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()` is generated based on specific contract parameters, including the contract's address, the chain ID, and a unique identifier. These parameters ensure that the domain separator is unique to the contract and the chain, and prevent attackers from using the same signature on a different chain or contract.

## Impact

- Inability to integrate `RioLRT` into contracts of other services where the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is used or strict adherence to the `EIP2612` standard is required.

- Various network analyzers that automatically determine the type of contracts will not be able to recognize that this is a token with a Permit function.

- Websites/exchanges/tools will not recognize that this is a token with a Permit function, and will therefore not provide users with the ability to pay less gas or use certain functionality, as they will not have access to the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` and automatically obtain the data.

- If the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()` function is missing from `ERC2612`, it can significantly impact the security of the standard. It can make it easier for attackers to replay valid signatures, since the domain separator provides a crucial part of the uniqueness and security of the signature.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to follow the ERC2612 specification strictly and ensure that the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is correctly implemented.
