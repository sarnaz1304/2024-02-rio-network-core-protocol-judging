# Storage Gap Collisions on Inheriting contracts

## Summary

No Storage Gap leading to corrupbility issues during the upgrade

## Vulnerability Detail

As clearly mentioned in the OpenZeppelin documentation about Modifiying/upgrading the contract, there must be reserve storage gap for reserving storage slots in the base contract.  

Simple, For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with exisiting deployments. In other case, it maybe very difficult to write new implementation code.

## Impact

For example, "RioLRTCoordination" contract inherits from the "RioLRTCore" contract and this contract does not contain any storage gap.  If in a future upgrage, an additional variable is added to the "RioLRTCore" contract, that new variable will overwrite the storage slot of the corresponding variable in the "RioLRTCoordinator" contract, causing unintended consequences.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the storage gap as suggested by Openzeppelin.

example:
```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap
```
