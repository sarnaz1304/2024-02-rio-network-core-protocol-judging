# M-5 : Violation of CEI pattern in RioLRTCoordinator

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The depositTokenToOperators inside OperatorOperations , the function does transfer the token in the middle ( external interaction).
Which violates  the Check Effects interaction pattern which is a security practice to avoid issues like re-entrancy to always make the checks and effects before interacting with external smart contarct.

Although in the current implementation, the asset might not have callbacks on receiving tokens but there is a possibility
that the protocol might allow receive callbacks based ERC20 tokens like ERC777 which contains call hooks using which 
the attacker can re-enter the contract and do malicious things that might even lead to user's loss of funds.

```solidity
   IERC20(token).safeTransfer(allocation.delegator, allocation.tokens);
         
```
So It is better to have CEI implemented already in order to prevent future hacks.

## Impact
The protocol might lose funds if the underlying ERC20 assets include callbacks or hooks on receiving tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement checks effects interaction and only interact with the contract at the very end of the function logic.
