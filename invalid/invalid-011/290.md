# Insufficient Validation in the `addOperator` Function leads to Excessive Addition of Operators

## Summary
The vulnerability lies in the `addOperator` function, which lacks proper validation to ensure that the maximum allowable number of active operators isn't exceeded. This oversight enables administrators to add operators beyond the intended limit, potentially causing system instability and violating protocol constraints.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability comes from the `addOperator` function not correctly checking whether the maximum active operator count has been exceeded. Currently, the code only checks if s.activeOperatorCount is equal to MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT, but it should verify if it is greater than or equal to MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT. This oversight allows an administrator to add operators even when the system is already above the maximum limit, leading to a potential breach of the protocol's intended constraints.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that the total number of active operators could surpass the intended maximum limit and still be able to add new Operators, violating the system's design and potentially causing unforeseen issues.

## Code Snippet

[Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorRegistryV1Admin.sol#L39)

## POC
Let's consider the following scenario :

1. Admin adds 40 operators: The activeOperatorCount would increase to 40, assuming all operators are activated upon addition (which the addOperator function does).

2. Admin deactivates 30 operators: The activeOperatorCount would decrease by 30, leaving 10 active operators.

3. Admin adds 30 new operators: The activeOperatorCount would increase by 30, resulting in 40 active operators (10 previously active + 30 newly added and activated).

4. Admin activates 30 operators that were deactivated: If the admin reactivates the 30 previously deactivated operators, the activeOperatorCount would increase by 30 again.

5. After all these operations, the total number of active operators would be 70 (40 active from step 3 + 30 reactivated).

As MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT = 70 we should not be able to add more operators, but in `addOperator()` we are checking whether the `s.activeOperatorCount == MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT` hence we can still be able to add operators and breaks the invariant.

```diff

        RioLRTOperatorRegistryStorageV1.StorageV1 storage s,
        address token,
        address operatorDelegatorBeacon,
        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorConfig memory config
    ) external returns (uint8 operatorId, address delegator) {
        if (config.operator == address(0)) revert IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.INVALID_OPERATOR();
        if (config.initialManager == address(0)) revert IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.INVALID_MANAGER();
        if (config.initialEarningsReceiver == address(0)) revert IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.INVALID_EARNINGS_RECEIVER();

        if (s.operatorCount == MAX_OPERATOR_COUNT) revert IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.MAX_OPERATOR_COUNT_EXCEEDED();
-        if (s.activeOperatorCount == MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT) {
+        if (s.activeOperatorCount >= MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT) {      
          revert IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT_EXCEEDED();
        }

        // Increment the operator count before assignment (First operator ID is 1)
        operatorId = ++s.operatorCount;
        s.activeOperatorCount += 1;

        // Create the operator with the provided salt and initialize it.
        delegator = CREATE3.deploy(
            computeOperatorSalt(operatorId),
            abi.encodePacked(type(BeaconProxy).creationCode, abi.encode(operatorDelegatorBeacon, '')),
            0
        );
        IRioLRTOperatorDelegator(delegator).initialize(token, config.operator);

        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorDetails storage _operator = s.operatorDetails[operatorId];
        _operator.active = true;
        _operator.manager = config.initialManager;
        _operator.earningsReceiver = config.initialEarningsReceiver;
        _operator.delegator = delegator;

        emit IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorAdded(
            operatorId,
            config.operator,
            delegator,
            config.initialManager,
            config.initialEarningsReceiver,
            config.initialMetadataURI
        );
