# `activateOperator` does not check `MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT`

## Summary
Activating an inactive operator does not check the maximum value for active operators. This breaks an important invariant when accessing elements from `OperatorUtilizationHeap` because there can be more elements on the heap than can be accessed. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Active operators can be added to `RioLRTOperatorRegistry` with the `addOperator()` function and when adding the maximum value can not exceed `MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT`. Active operators can become deactivated by the `RioLRTOperatorRegistry` owner, in which case they are removed from the `activeOperatorCount`. When they are activated again the  `activeOperatorCount` is increased again but it is not checked if the number of active operators has been increased up  `MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT` since deactivation. 

## Impact
This issue can have negative issues beyond just having an undesired number of active operators. For instance, in `getOperatorUtilizationHeapForETH`, the heap is initialized with `MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT`, but `activeOperatorCount` can be greater than that. So, initializing the `OperatorUtilizationHeap` can cause active operators to be missing. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function activateOperator(RioLRTOperatorRegistryStorageV1.StorageV1 storage s, uint8 operatorId) external {
        IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OperatorDetails storage operator = s.operatorDetails[operatorId];

        if (operator.delegator == address(0)) revert IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.INVALID_OPERATOR_DELEGATOR();
        if (operator.active) revert IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.OPERATOR_ALREADY_ACTIVE();

        operator.active = true;
        s.activeOperatorCount += 1;
```

## Recommendation
Check `MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT` when an operator is activated.
