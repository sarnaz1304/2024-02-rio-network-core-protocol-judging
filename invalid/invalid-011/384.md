# No check to ensure maximum number of active operators does not exceed allowed limit

## Summary
No check to ensure maximum number of active operators does not exceed allowed limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here in OperatorRegistryV1Admin.sol [activateOperator()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/OperatorRegistryV1Admin.sol#L95-L105) there is no check applied to make sure maximum number of active operators < MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT. 

## Impact
It affects the core functionality of the protocol as there may be many operatos which were added before and deactivated later but can  activated again without respecting the limit on active operators allowed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Apply check to ensure maximum number of active operators is within allowed limit
` if (s.activeOperatorCount == MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT) {`
           ` revert IRioLRTOperatorRegistry.MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATOR_COUNT_EXCEEDED();`
      `  }`
