# Transferring any of the supported tokens while totalsupply == 0 will break desposit for the next user

## Summary
Sending any of the supported tokens to LRTDepositPool while totalSupply() == 0, will cause the next user not to receive shares

## Vulnerability Detail
When calculating the amount of shares to receive, the function has two scenarios:

If the pool is empty, it will see it as initial mint and mint shares according to the amount deposited because totalSupply = 0 then.
But if we transfer any supported token and 1 wei used to the fund, totalSupply would still be 0 and the pool != 0.
When a user deposits after, the above will trigger the else statement.
That leads to the following calculation: (amount * 0) / pool = 0.

This could occur if 
1. The attacker is the first to deposit 
2. if totalSupply is reduced to 0 at a given moment.

## Impact
Griefing real user's deposit
