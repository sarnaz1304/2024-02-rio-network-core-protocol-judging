# The depositETHToOperators function there is rounding errors during deposit calculations leading to loss of funds.

## Summary
The depositETHToOperators function there is rounding errors during deposit calculations, leading to loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue arises due to integer division in Solidity, resulting in the truncation of fractional amounts. For example, when dividing the deposited amount by a constant, fractional parts are ignored, leading to potential loss or mismanagement of funds.

This will get all total amount to deposit into the eigen layer so 
```solidity
uint256 amountToDeposit = asset.getSelfBalance();
```
Let's consider a scenario where an amount of 1000 ETH is deposited, and ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE is set to 32.

       1000 / 32 = 31.25

In this scenario, due to integer division in Solidity, the result would be rounded down to 31. This means that a fraction of Ethereum (0.25 ETH) would be left unaccounted for, leading to a potential loss.

## Impact
Loss of funds or discrepancies in deposit handling.
