# Inadequate checks on the quality of price feed data

## Summary
The Line#36 of `ChainlinkPriceFeed.sol` grabs the `updatedAt` timestamp from Chainlink's `latestRoundData()`, then it takes a timeout window `stalePriceDelay` which was previously subjectively determined by the Rio team,  and compares the sum to the current `block.timestamp`, to determine the validity of the price. However, only utilizing `updatedAt` and a self-defined `stalePriceDelay` is not adequate enough to ensure the quality of the price feed data, because the heartbeat of the Chainlink nodes are not being checked.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider this scenario: the Chainlink nodes maybe already offline while the last price feed still has an `updatedAt` timestamp which is acceptably recent enough according to Rio team's own criteria (which was somehow subjectively defined). However, if the nodes were still online, possibly there could have been even a newer price which is more recently. So, technically the price received by Rio's contract maybe still outdated and more deviated from the real current price.

## Impact
Prices not recent enough is still possibly getting accepted by the protocol when the nodes are actually already offline, and opens the door for attackers to exploit the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Besides using the `updatedAt` for verification, also to implement a logic in the `getPrice()` function to check Chainlink nodes' heartbeat timestamp as well. Because Chainlink's price update and heartbeat, although often move in tandem, are NOT strictly coupled --- it's possible for one to update without the other. Checking the heartbeat to ensure the liveliness of the nodes can help Rio team to be certain that the price feed is not only acceptably recent enough per the team's criteria, but also guaranteed it is by far the best info that the oracle can provide.
