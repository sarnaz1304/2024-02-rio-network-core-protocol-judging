# Delegation may fail if Operator sets a delegationApprover

## Summary
When RioLRTOperatorDelegator is initialized, it delegates to an operator. But this delegation assumes that the operator does not have a delegationApprover and therefore hardcodes an empty signature and expiry. If the operator has a delegationApprover, then the initialization will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `initialize`, RioLRTOperatorDelegator hardcodes `delegateTo` with an empty signature and expiry time.
```solidity
delegationManager.delegateTo(
	operator,
	ISignatureUtils.SignatureWithExpiry(new bytes(0), 0),
	bytes32(0)
);
```

A delegationApprover has to pre-approve anyone who wishes to delegate to the operator. It is set when the operator first registers with EigenLayer and it is optional for the operator to set this. See [link](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/e12b03f20f7dceded8de9c6901ab05cfe61a2113/docs/core/DelegationManager.md#:~:text=address%20delegationApprover%3A%20if%20set%2C%20this%20address%20must%20sign%20and%20approve%20new%20delegation%20from%20Stakers%20to%20this%20Operator%20(optional)).

If a delegationApprover is set, then calling `delegateTo` with a false/empty signature will fail:
https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/core/DelegationManager.sol#L479
```solidity
// Eigenlayer DelegationManager.sol

function _delegate(
        address staker,
        address operator,
        SignatureWithExpiry memory approverSignatureAndExpiry,
        bytes32 approverSalt
) {
	...

	if (_delegationApprover != address(0) && msg.sender != _delegationApprover && msg.sender != operator) {
	// check the signature expiry
	require(
		approverSignatureAndExpiry.expiry >= block.timestamp,
		"DelegationManager._delegate: approver signature expired"
	);

	...
	// actually check that the signature is valid
	EIP1271SignatureUtils.checkSignature_EIP1271(
		_delegationApprover,
		approverDigestHash,
		approverSignatureAndExpiry.signature
	);
}
```
## Impact
It is reasonable to assume professional operators will set a delegationApprover to control who can use their services. They may do this to preclude certain geographies or blacklisted addresses from using their services.

By hardcoding the empty signature in `initialize`, Rio loses the flexibility to delegate to an operator that has set a delegationApprover.

## Recommendation
Do not hard code a zero signature and expiry time, but allow `initialize` function parameters pass it in.
