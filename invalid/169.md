# Depositors could lose their funds permanently.

## Summary
Depositors could lose their funds permanently.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L105

## Vulnerability Detail

a depositor could be a contract and if it is contract the user can lose his funds for ever if he deposited ETH.

1) alice has contract and she wants to deposit ETH from that contract.
2) now alice deposited ETH, and after a period of time she requestWithdrawal.
3) alice calls [claimWithdrawalsForEpoch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L92-L108) but if alice contract has no receive/fallback or alice execute code in receive/fallback it will revert because transferTo uses 10_000 as gas to prevent reentrancy [transferETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/Asset.sol#L42)
  now alice wont be able to get her ETH again.

## Impact

Depositors could lose their funds permanently.

## Code Snippet

POC:
put this in RioLRTCoordinator.t.sol

```solidity
    function test_RevertIfUserHasNoReceive() public {
        reETH.coordinator.depositETH{value: 10 ether}();
        reETH.coordinator.requestWithdrawal(ETH_ADDRESS, 10 ether);

        vm.prank(EOA, EOA); 
        reETH.coordinator.rebalance(ETH_ADDRESS);

        reETH.withdrawalQueue.claimWithdrawalsForEpoch(
            IRioLRTWithdrawalQueue.ClaimRequest({asset: ETH_ADDRESS, epoch: 0})
        );
    }

    // NOTE: be sure to comment this.
    // receive() external payable {}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow user to specify where ETH is sent, this is better for user experience.

```diff
-   function claimWithdrawalsForEpoch(ClaimRequest calldata request) public returns(uint256 amountOut) {
+   function claimWithdrawalsForEpoch(ClaimRequest calldata request, address receiver) public returns(uint256 amountOut) {
        address withdrawer = msg.sender;

        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(request.asset, request.epoch);
        if (!epochWithdrawals.settled) revert EPOCH_NOT_SETTLED();

        UserWithdrawalSummary memory userSummary = epochWithdrawals.users[withdrawer];
        if (userSummary.sharesOwed == 0) revert NO_SHARES_OWED_IN_EPOCH();
        if (userSummary.claimed) revert WITHDRAWAL_ALREADY_CLAIMED();

        epochWithdrawals.users[withdrawer].claimed = true;

        amountOut = userSummary.sharesOwed.mulDiv(epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived, epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed);

-       request.asset.transferTo(withdrawer, amountOut);
+       request.asset.transferTo(receiver, amountOut);

-       emit WithdrawalsClaimedForEpoch(request.epoch, request.asset, withdrawer, amountOut);
+       emit WithdrawalsClaimedForEpoch(request.epoch, request.asset, receiver, amountOut);
    }
```
