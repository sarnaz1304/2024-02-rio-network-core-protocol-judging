# Owner can Unfairly Reset Rebalance Delay Causing DoS to Innocent Users

## Summary
Owner can Unfairly Reset Rebalance Delay which would affect a innocent User's Interaction by causing Denial of Service
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    /// @notice Sets the rebalance delay.
    /// @param newRebalanceDelay The new rebalance delay, in seconds.
    function setRebalanceDelay(uint24 newRebalanceDelay) external onlyOwner {
>>>        _setRebalanceDelay(newRebalanceDelay);
    }
...
 /// @dev Sets the rebalance delay.
    /// @param newRebalanceDelay The new rebalance delay, in seconds.
    function _setRebalanceDelay(uint24 newRebalanceDelay) internal {
        if (newRebalanceDelay > MAX_REBALANCE_DELAY) revert REBALANCE_DELAY_TOO_LONG();
        rebalanceDelay = newRebalanceDelay;

        emit RebalanceDelaySet(newRebalanceDelay);
    }
```
The function above shows how owner can reset Rebalance delay, it can be noted that there is no restriction to resetting new rebalancedelay time frame even if it would affect a user that is still working with the previous time frame.
```solidity
   /// @notice Require that the rebalance delay has been met.
    /// @param asset The asset being rebalanced.
>>>    modifier checkRebalanceDelayMet(address asset) {
        _checkRebalanceDelayMet(asset);
        _;
    }
```
The code below shows how rebalance(...) function is executed by first calling the modifier provided above, this was just provided to have an understanding of the work flow, however the problem this report is pointing out can be understood by going through the comment and code in the second pointer in the code provided below.
```solidity
>>>   function rebalance(address asset) external checkRebalanceDelayMet(asset) {
        if (!assetRegistry().isSupportedAsset(asset)) revert ASSET_NOT_SUPPORTED(asset);
        if (msg.sender != tx.origin) revert CALLER_MUST_BE_EOA();

        // Process any outstanding withdrawals using funds from the deposit pool and EigenLayer.
        uint256 sharesOwed = withdrawalQueue().getSharesOwedInCurrentEpoch(asset);
        if (sharesOwed > 0) {
            _processUserWithdrawalsForCurrentEpoch(asset, sharesOwed);
        }

        // Deposit remaining assets into EigenLayer.
        (uint256 sharesReceived, bool isDepositCapped) = depositPool().depositBalanceIntoEigenLayer(asset);
        if (sharesOwed == 0 && sharesReceived == 0) {
            revert NO_REBALANCE_NEEDED();
        }
        if (sharesReceived > 0) {
            if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) {
                assetRegistry().increaseUnverifiedValidatorETHBalance(sharesReceived);
            } else {
                assetRegistry().increaseSharesHeldForAsset(asset, sharesReceived);
            }
        }
>>>    // When the deposit is not capped, the rebalance is considered complete, and the asset rebalance
>>>        // timestamp is increased by the specified delay. If capped, the asset may be rebalanced again
        // immediately as there are more assets to deposit.
        if (!isDepositCapped) {
            assetNextRebalanceAfter[asset] = uint40(block.timestamp) + rebalanceDelay;
        }
        emit Rebalanced(asset);
    }
```
As clearly stated we can have a situation when users need to re-call rebalance again if Deposit is Capped, the problem is that, when user has not completed rebalance, Owner can unfairly change the rebalance delay which would cause Denial of Service to the User Transaction due to a new time frame and against the old lower time frame.
### Scenario
A vulnerability Scenario would look like this
- User calls rebalance(...) function with Capped Deposit and needs to Rebalance again
- Owner Resets Rebalance Delay to an Higher time frame or days
- User tries to Rebalance again to complete transaction but it fails as rebalance period has been changed causing Denial of Service for the User.
## Impact
Owner can Unfairly Reset Rebalance Delay which would affect a innocent User's Interaction by causing Denial of Service

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Protocol should consider using a constant Delay Period instead of an Adjustable Delay Period
