# M-6 Discrepencies in block.timestamp typecasting

## Summary
Block timestamp is typecasted differently in different parts of the code leading to inconsistency and potentially bricking the system due to interoperability issues with different components typecasting it differently

## Vulnerability Detail

RioLRT.sol

```solidity

 function clock() public view override returns (uint48) {
        return uint48(block.timestamp);
    }

```

RioLRT#rebalance()

```solidity
// remaining code
if (!isDepositCapped) {
            assetNextRebalanceAfter[asset] = uint40(block.timestamp) + rebalanceDelay;
        }

```

RioToken.sol

```solidity
  function clock() public view override returns (uint48) {
        return uint48(block.timestamp);
    }
```

RioDeployer.sol

```solidity

// MockBeaconChain#setNextTimestamp :

function setNextTimestamp(uint256 timestamp) public {
        nextTimestamp = uint64(timestamp);
    }


// RioDeployer.sol#verifyCredentialsForValidators
        beaconChain.setNextTimestamp(block.timestamp);

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider having a uniform typecasting, like uint48 in all the places
