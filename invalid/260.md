# M-1 : ChainlinkPriceFeed DoS in-case old oracle gets abandoned

## Summary
If default source oracle defaults , the entire core functionality of the RioNetwork based on pricing will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink can abandon the oracles based upon bad actions and performance.
In the constructor of `contracts/oracle/ChainlinkPriceFeed.sol`, we are setting the initial oracle as `source`.
The oracle address will be used to fetch price feed information.
However , as chainlink oracles can be abandoned based upon some certain behaviours , we might need to change the source
of priceFeed information.

However in our current implementation , we neither have a setter/upgrader for oracle address nor we have an upgradable pattern
for the contract. 
So if the underlying oracle address has been removed from chainlink network , 
our entire priceFeed functionality will be deemed useless because we can neither upgrade the contract nor the address of source oracle.

```solidity

 constructor(address source_, uint256 stalePriceDelay_) {
        source = source_;
        stalePriceDelay = stalePriceDelay_;

        decimals = IChainlinkAggregatorV3(source_).decimals();
        description = IChainlinkAggregatorV3(source_).description();
    }

    /// @notice Get the current price.
    function getPrice() external view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainlinkAggregatorV3(source).latestRoundData();
        if (block.timestamp > updatedAt + stalePriceDelay) revert STALE_PRICE();
        if (price <= 0) revert BAD_PRICE();

        return uint256(price);
    }
```
As currently we not have any backup price source too , so the impact is high.

I believe it's severity is atleast Medium due to

Impact : High - core functionality can be broken
Likelihood : Low

## Impact

Loss of core functionality of protocol price information

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a Setter for upgrading source oracle address or implement upgradable pattern for smart contract
