# Wrong parameter usage breaks withdrawal functionality

## Summary
Due to the wrong usage of `struct Withdrawal`, this contract wont be usable with M2 EigenLayer.
## Vulnerability Detail
`RioLRTDepositPool.completeOperatorWithdrawalForAsset` uses the following parameters:
```javascript
    function completeOperatorWithdrawalForAsset(
        address asset,
        uint8 operatorId,
        IDelegationManager.Withdrawal calldata queuedWithdrawal,
        uint256 middlewareTimesIndex
    ) external {
//.. code omitted
    }
```
- `address asset`
- `uint8 operatorId`
- `IDelegationManager.Withdrawal calldata queuedWithdrawal`
- `uint256 middlewareTimesIndex`

If we take a closer look at `IDelegationManager.Withdrawal`, we see that this is a `struct` named `Withdrawal` from `IDelegationManager.sol`:

[IDelegationManager.sol#L68-L83](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/interfaces/eigenlayer/IDelegationManager.sol#L68-L83)
```javascript
    struct Withdrawal {
        // The address that originated the Withdrawal
        address staker;
        // The address that the staker was delegated to at the time that the Withdrawal was created
        address delegatedTo;
        // The address that can complete the Withdrawal + will receive funds when completing the withdrawal
        address withdrawer;
        // Nonce used to guarantee that otherwise identical withdrawals have unique hashes
        uint256 nonce;
        // Block number when the Withdrawal was created
        uint32 startBlock;
        // Array of strategies that the Withdrawal contains
        address[] strategies;
        // Array containing the amount of shares in each Strategy in the `strategies` array
        uint256[] shares;
    }
```

`IDelegationManager.Withdrawal calldata queuedWithdrawal` is used as a parameter inside `completeOperatorWithdrawalForAsset`:

[RioLRTDepositPool.sol#L144](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTDepositPool.sol#L144)
```javascript
delegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawal(queuedWithdrawal, asset.toArray(), middlewareTimesIndex, true);

```
This is a problem since the Sponsor is targeting this specific `v0.2.1-goerli-m2` release.

Currently, the `IDelegationManager.Withdrawal` used is inherited from `IDelegationManager.sol` which cause an issue because it is using the old `struct Withdrawal`. If we look at the targeted release, the `struct Withdrawal` looks like this:

[IDelegationManager.sol#L77-L92](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/interfaces/IDelegationManager.sol#L77-L92)
```javascript
    struct Withdrawal {
        // The address that originated the Withdrawal
        address staker;
        // The address that the staker was delegated to at the time that the Withdrawal was created
        address delegatedTo;
        // The address that can complete the Withdrawal + will receive funds when completing the withdrawal
        address withdrawer;
        // Nonce used to guarantee that otherwise identical withdrawals have unique hashes
        uint256 nonce;
        // Block number when the Withdrawal was created
        uint32 startBlock;
        // Array of strategies that the Withdrawal contains
        IStrategy[] strategies;
        // Array containing the amount of shares in each Strategy in the `strategies` array
        uint256[] shares;
    }
```
## Impact
As you can see, `IStrategy[]` is used instead of `address[]`.  This means that the calls made to the `DelegationManager` contract using `completeOperatorWithdrawalForAsset` will fail, since that release uses a different struct that uses `IStrategy[]`.

Therefore, it will not be possible to complete the withdrawal of funds.

Note: The same applies to the parameters of  `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.settleEpochFromEigenLayer`, the old struct is used in here as parameter as well. Also applies to `RioLRTOperatorDelegator._queueWithdrawal()`.
