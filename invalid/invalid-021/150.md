# `completeOperatorWithdrawalForAsset` does not work with M2 EigenLayer

## Summary
`completeOperatorWithdrawalForAsset` does not work with M2 EigenLayer,

## Vulnerability Detail
In `RioLRTDepositPool.completeOperatorWithdrawalForAsset`:
```javascript
    function completeOperatorWithdrawalForAsset(
        address asset,
        uint8 operatorId,
        IDelegationManager.Withdrawal calldata queuedWithdrawal,
        uint256 middlewareTimesIndex
    ) external {
        // Only allow one strategy exit at a time.
        if (queuedWithdrawal.strategies.length != 1) revert INVALID_WITHDRAWAL_STRATEGY_LENGTH();

        // Verify that the withdrawal originated from an operator delegator within the system.
        IRioLRTOperatorDelegator operatorDelegator_ = operatorDelegator(operatorRegistry(), operatorId);
        if (queuedWithdrawal.staker != address(operatorDelegator_)) {
            revert INVALID_WITHDRAWAL_ORIGIN();
        }

        // If ETH, decrease the amount of ETH queued for withdrawal. Otherwise, decrease the
        // amount of shares held for the asset.
        address strategy = queuedWithdrawal.strategies[0];
        if (strategy == BEACON_CHAIN_STRATEGY) {
            operatorDelegator_.decreaseETHQueuedForOperatorExitOrScrape(queuedWithdrawal.shares[0]);
        } else {
            assetRegistry().decreaseSharesHeldForAsset(asset, queuedWithdrawal.shares[0]);
        }

        // Complete the withdrawal. This function verifies that the passed `asset` is correct.
->        delegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawal(queuedWithdrawal, asset.toArray(), middlewareTimesIndex, true);

        emit OperatorAssetWithdrawalCompleted(operatorId, asset, keccak256(abi.encode(queuedWithdrawal)));
    }
```
the `completeQueuedWithdrawal` function gets called to complete the withdrawal from EigenLayer for a specified asset and operator.

The second parameter used to call `copmleteQueuedWithdrawal` is of type `address[]`, in this case, `asset.toArray()`. This matches the parameters required of the interface that is used for `delegationManager`:

[IDelegationManager.sol#L232-L237](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/interfaces/eigenlayer/IDelegationManager.sol#L232-L237)
```javascript
    function completeQueuedWithdrawal(
        Withdrawal calldata withdrawal,
        address[] calldata tokens,
        uint256 middlewareTimesIndex,
        bool receiveAsTokens
    ) external;
```
However, the `v0.2.1-goerli-m2` version of `DelegationManager.sol`, which is being targetted as per the Sponsor, requires different parameters:

[IDelegationManager.sol#L260-L265](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/interfaces/IDelegationManager.sol#L260-L265)
```javascript
    function completeQueuedWithdrawal(
        Withdrawal calldata withdrawal,
        IERC20[] calldata tokens,
        uint256 middlewareTimesIndex,
        bool receiveAsTokens
    ) external onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_EXIT_WITHDRAWAL_QUEUE) nonReentrant {
        _completeQueuedWithdrawal(withdrawal, tokens, middlewareTimesIndex, receiveAsTokens);
    }
```

As you can see, in the M2 version of the contracts, `IERC20[]` gets used.
If you run this PoC to mock a call using `address[]` when `IERC20[]` is asked:
```javascript
import {IERC20} from '@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol';
import {Test} from 'forge-std/Test.sol';

contract poc is Test {
  
  function setUp(){}

  function _internalTest(IERC20[] calldata tokens) internal returns(bool){
    return true;
  }

  function testThis() public {
    address[] calldata addressArray = new address[](1);
    addressArray[0] = address(1337);
    _internalTest(addressArray);
  }
}
```

It will result in the following error:
```bash
Error (9553): Invalid type for argument in function call. Invalid implicit conversion from address[] calldata to contract IERC20[] calldata requested.
  --> test/test.t.sol:15:19:
   |
15 |     _internalTest(addressArray);
   |          
```

## Impact
This means that it is currently not possible for a person to complete the withdrawal from EigenLayer using `RioLRTDepositPool.completeOperatorWithdrawalForAsset()`, resulting in a loss of funds and breaking the usage of this protocol since it won't be possible to make withdrawals from EigenLayer.

Note: `RioLRTWithdrawalQueue` uses the old `IDelegationManager.sol` interface as well, which means that the `completeQueuedWithdrawal` calls will be affected by the same issue as described above.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Use the interface provided for`v0.2.1-goerli-m2`  contracts and use `IERC20[]` instead of `address[]`.
