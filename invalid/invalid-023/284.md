# TVL of LRTs that accept ETH as an asset but have a non-ETH unit of conversion will be accounted for incorrectly

## Summary
TVL of LRTs that accept ETH as an asset but have a non-ETH unit of conversion will be accounted for incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function [RioLRTAssetRegistry::getTVLForAsset()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol#L79-L85) is used in the calculation of the total TVL of an LRT. 

The function never converts ETH into the unit of conversion of the LRT:
```solidity
function getTVLForAsset(address asset) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balance = getTotalBalanceForAsset(asset);
    if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) {
        return balance;
    }
    return convertToUnitOfAccountFromAsset(asset, balance);
}
```

If an LRT accepts ETH as an asset but uses a non-ETH unit of conversion the whole accounting of the LRT TVL will be done incorrectly. As an example, if the unit of conversion is USDC a single ETH will be considered worth 1e18 USDC. This makes it possible to massively increase the LRT TVL by depositing a fraction of ETH, which will massively increase the value of LRT tokens and allow to steal other accepted assets.

## Impact
Funds can be stolen.

## Recommendation
Convert ETH to unit of account when necessary or prevent ETH to be added as an asset to LRTs that have a non-ETH unit of conversion.
