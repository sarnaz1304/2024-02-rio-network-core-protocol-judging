# unbounded loop can cause the RioLRTWithdrawalQueue reach the block gas limit

## Summary
The smart contract exhibits potential gas efficiency concerns, specifically in the claimWithdrawalsForManyEpochs function. This function iterates through an array of ClaimRequest objects, calling the claimWithdrawalsForEpoch function for each request. Gas-related issues may arise, particularly if the array size becomes excessively large, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. This report outlines the details of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommendations for optimization.

## Vulnerability Detail
The claimWithdrawalsForManyEpochs function iterates through an array of ClaimRequest objects, calling the claimWithdrawalsForEpoch function for each request. The unbounded nature of this loop poses a risk of exceeding the block gas limit, especially when processing a large array of requests. This could result in transaction failures due to gas-related issues.

## Impact
The gas efficiency concerns in the claimWithdrawalsForManyEpochs function may lead to transaction failures if gas consumption exceeds the block limit, increasing costs for users who resort to individual claims. This could result in poor user experiences, potential network congestion, and operational inefficiency due to suboptimal gas usage

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L119

    function claimWithdrawalsForManyEpochs(ClaimRequest[] calldata requests)
        external
        returns (uint256[] memory amountsOut)
    {
        uint256 requestLength = requests.length;

        amountsOut = new uint256[](requestLength);
        for (uint256 i; i < requestLength; ++i) {
            amountsOut[i] = claimWithdrawalsForEpoch(requests[i]);
        }
    }

this s the logic performed by claimWithdrawalsForEpoch
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTWithdrawalQueue.sol#L92

    function claimWithdrawalsForEpoch(ClaimRequest calldata request) public returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        address withdrawer = msg.sender;

        EpochWithdrawals storage epochWithdrawals = _getEpochWithdrawals(request.asset, request.epoch);
        if (!epochWithdrawals.settled) revert EPOCH_NOT_SETTLED();

        UserWithdrawalSummary memory userSummary = epochWithdrawals.users[withdrawer];
        if (userSummary.sharesOwed == 0) revert NO_SHARES_OWED_IN_EPOCH();
        if (userSummary.claimed) revert WITHDRAWAL_ALREADY_CLAIMED();

        epochWithdrawals.users[withdrawer].claimed = true;

        amountOut = userSummary.sharesOwed.mulDiv(epochWithdrawals.assetsReceived, epochWithdrawals.sharesOwed);
        request.asset.transferTo(withdrawer, amountOut);

        emit WithdrawalsClaimedForEpoch(request.epoch, request.asset, withdrawer, amountOut);
    }


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the claimWithdrawalsForManyEpochs function to process epochs in batches, allowing users to claim withdrawals in smaller increments. This prevents the unbounded loop from exceeding the block gas limit for large array sizes.
