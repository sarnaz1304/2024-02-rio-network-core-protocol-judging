# Token Amount Value would be Lost due to Precision Loss from Token Decimal Conversion

## Summary
Token Amount Value would be Lost due to Precision Loss after _normalizeDecimals(...) function call in the RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol contract  during Decimal conversion
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  function _normalizeDecimals(uint256 amount, uint8 fromDecimals, uint8 toDecimals) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        // No adjustment needed if decimals are the same.
        if (fromDecimals == toDecimals) {
            return amount;
        }
        // Scale down to match the target decimal precision.
        if (fromDecimals > toDecimals) {
   >>>         return amount / 10 ** (fromDecimals - toDecimals);
        }
        // Scale up to match the target decimal precision.
        return amount * 10 ** (toDecimals - fromDecimals);
    }
```
The function above shows how _normalizeDecimals(...) function is implemented for token decimal conversion in the RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol contract, the problem is that when Decimal is being converted from a token with higher decimal value to Token with Lower decimal Value due to the division operation as noted from the pointer from the code above, There would be precision loss and this excess value is not accounted for, it would be completely lost to the smart contract calling this conversion.
## Impact
Token Amount Value would be Lost due to Precision Loss after _normalizeDecimals(...) function call in the RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rio Protocol should make necessary implementation to ensure this token value is not completely lost during Token Decimal conversion and to ensure the excess value can be extracted when needed by the protocol
