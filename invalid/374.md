# the `removeAsset` function logic has problem in deleting assets

## Summary
the `removeAsset` function logic has problem in deleting assets 
## Vulnerability Detail
in contract `RioLRTAssetRegistry.sol` ,funtion `removeAsset` have purpose of deleting the assets while checking if the asset dont have any tvl and delete it. 
function used to find index of the assets in assets address array         `uint256 assetIndex = _findAssetIndex(asset);`

and then its going to delete the assets using line  `supportedAssets.pop();` and this is supported assets `    /// @notice All supported assets.
    address[] public supportedAssets;` 
    
    but what as `.pop()` will delete element in array from the end but the lets say onlyowner want to remove the asset from the middle of array but this code will delete from end and has not used index of asets that need be deleted. 
    
 **Note**: function checks that asset should have 0 tvl to be able to delete it but because the asset need to be deleted is different than last asset of array the checks for tvl is going to apply one only input asset 
    

## Impact
the last added asset of array will be completely deleted while having TVL and thus loss of funds for asset owners. because checks for tvl will be passed.
and still it will delete the data of asset which given in input.  in `        delete assetInfo[asset];
`
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
  function removeAsset(address asset) external onlyOwner {
        if (!isSupportedAsset(asset)) revert ASSET_NOT_SUPPORTED(asset);
        if (getTVLForAsset(asset) > 0) revert ASSET_HAS_BALANCE();

        uint256 assetCount = supportedAssets.length;
        uint256 assetIndex = _findAssetIndex(asset);

        supportedAssets[assetIndex] = supportedAssets[assetCount - 1];
        supportedAssets.pop();
        //@audit this logic will delete the last data in mapping but its wrong because the asset that need to be removed can be in the middle
            delete assetInfo[asset];

        emit AssetRemoved(asset);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider deleting assets from array with index of those assets in array. `_findAssetIndex` can be used here too.
