# The contract RioLRT allows users to burn tokens even when the burn amount is zero.

## Summary
In the burn function of the RioLRT contract, there is no check to ensure that the burn amount is greater than zero. As a result, users can invoke the burn function with a zero amount, resulting in a transaction that consumes gas without any actual burning of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
This vulnerability allows users to add unnecessary tx on blockchain, waste gas by invoking the burn function with zero as the burn amount, leading to unnecessary transaction costs and can also lead to the DOS attack.

## Proof Of Concept
The below test case shows how user can burn 0 amount.
```javascript
  function test_burn() public {
        token.burn(0);
     }
```
Output:-
```javascript
Ran 1 test for test/RioLRT.t.sol:RioLRTTest
[PASS] test_burn() (gas: 28029)
Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 30.21ms
```
## Impact
This vulnerability allows users to waste gas by invoking the burn function with zero as the burn amount, leading to unnecessary transaction and DOS attack.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/main/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRT.sol#L61

```javascript
 /// @notice Burn `amount` tokens from the `msg.sender`.
    /// @param amount The amount of tokens to burn.
    function burn(uint256 amount) public override(IRioLRT, ERC20BurnableUpgradeable) {
        super.burn(amount);
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review, foundry

## Recommendation
Add a check in the burn function to ensure that the burn amount is greater than zero before proceeding with the burning operation.

```diff
 /// @notice Burn `amount` tokens from the `msg.sender`.
    /// @param amount The amount of tokens to burn.
    function burn(uint256 amount) public override(IRioLRT, ERC20BurnableUpgradeable) {
+       require(amount > 0, "Amount to burn must be greater than zero");
        super.burn(amount);
    }
```
