# Validator count can not be predictably reduce for an operator

## Summary

When the operator cap is decreased it does not automatically withdraw validators such that cap <=100%.

This is functionality is required to predictably reduce an operators validator count without forcing a 100% validator exit.
## Vulnerability Detail

When `setOperatorValidatorCap()` is called on RioLRTOperatorRegistry and the `0< newShareCap.cap< currentShareDetails.cap` we will simply update the heap but not queue withdrawals

```solidity
} else {
	// Otherwise, update the operator's utilization in the heap.
	
		utilizationHeap.updateUtilizationByID(operatorId, currentShareDetails.allocation.divWad(newShareCap.cap));

}
```

If Rio wishes to decrease the validators for an operator they will therefore be forced to reduce the cap to 0. Otherwise they will be relying on withdrawals > deposit to slowly reduce the caps. 
## Impact

If rio wishes to decrease the active validators for a set of validators they can not predictably do so without forcing all activate validators to exit. 

Withdrawing more validators than necessary will lead to loss of yield since the surplus validator exits have to enter a queue to both withdraw and enter the validator set.

Example:

1. Operator 1 has a 1000 activate validators and a cap of 1000
2. Rio wished to decrease this to 600 to decrease the exposure to this specific Operator
3. Rio can only decrease the cap but will not queue 400 validators to exits.
4. Rio will have to set the cap to 0 and force 100% of validators to exit to predictably reduce it to 400.
5. Rio will otherwise rely on deposits < withdrawal to decrease the utilization of all operators >100%. If deposits > withdrawal, the cap will stay at >100%.

## Tool used

Manual Review
## Recommendation

Add a `bool` parameter `queue` to `setOperatorValidatorCap()`. If `queue = true` validators will be queued for withdrawal such that that utilization is decreased to 100%.
