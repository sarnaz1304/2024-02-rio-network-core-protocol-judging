# User can lose up to 1 gwei on withdrawal.

## Summary

Users can lose up to 1 gwei for withdrawals in ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user requests a withdrawal in ETH, the amount of shares owed is reduced to the precision of a gwei, but the amount of restaking tokens to be pulled from the user's balance is not updated to reflect this. This means that the user can lose up to 1 gwei on withdrawal.

## Impact

Users can lose up to 1 gwei on withdrawal.
