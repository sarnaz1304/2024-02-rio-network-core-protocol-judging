# Operators can cause verification of other operators to fail by verifying a validator that was added outside Rio

## Summary
Operators can cause verification of other operators to fail by verifying a validator that was added outside Rio

## Vulnerability Detail
The `verifyWithdrawalCredentials` function decreases the unverified ETH validator balance once the verification in eigenlayer proves successful  

```solidity
    function verifyWithdrawalCredentials(
        uint8 operatorId,
        uint64 oracleTimestamp,
        IBeaconChainProofs.StateRootProof calldata stateRootProof,
        uint40[] calldata validatorIndices,
        bytes[] calldata validatorFieldsProofs,
        bytes32[][] calldata validatorFields
    ) external onlyOperatorManagerOrProofUploader(operatorId) {

        ....

=>      assetRegistry().decreaseUnverifiedValidatorETHBalance(validatorIndices.length * ETH_DEPOSIT_SIZE);


        emit OperatorWithdrawalCredentialsVerified(operatorId, oracleTimestamp, validatorIndices);
    }
```

This assumes that the corresponding amount of ETH has been added to `unverifiedValidatorETHBalance` beforehand when the deposit from validator was made. But this need not be the case.
An operator can add a validator from outside Rio and have the eigenpod as the withdrawal address. This will make the verification in eigenpod pass but will not have increased the `unverifiedValidatorETHBalance`. 
This will cause the verification of latest operators to fail since `unverifiedValidatorETHBalance` would underflow, effectively loosing these ETH until another deposit increases the `unverifiedValidatorETHBalance` and takes the earlier operators place

But this would require an operator to sacrifice atleast 1 ETH (as the operator has to set the withdrawal credentials to eigenpod) in exchange for the grief.

## Impact
Operators can grief last verifications. In case the
