# Upgrade `OwnableUpgradeable` to `Ownable2StepUpgradeable`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract ```RioLRTRewardDistributor``` inherits from the ```OwnableUpgradeable``` contract by OpenZeppelin. In the case of the designated Owner calling the function ```transferOwnership```, they may accidentally transfer the ownership to an uncontrolled EoA or to a contract that may not be able to interact with the ownership at all. That could also be the case if the initial address provided for the owner is an invalid one.

## Impact

All of the functions with the ```onlyOwner``` modifier won't be accessible.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A better option has been created by OpenZeppelin - [```Ownable2StepUpgradeable```](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2StepUpgradeable.sol), which provides a two-step verification that can prevent an accidental transfer of the ownership.
