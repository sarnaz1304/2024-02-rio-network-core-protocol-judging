# Reward distribution can be sandwiched

## Summary
Adversary can sandwich reward allocation by depositing ETH/LST and requesting a withdrawal right after.

## Vulnerability Detail

Rewards are implemented by direct deposit of ETH into DepositPool, so the price of reETH ("shares") in ETH terms increases immediately. Because of that, and because reETH is minted on deposits immediately, it is possible to steal the majority of rewards without actually restaking. 

The attacker would only need to frontrun rewards with `deposit`, and backrun with `requestWithdrawal`. After that, two outcomes are possible:

1. `epochDeposits >= epochRequestedWithdrawals`:

The sandwicher receives back his underlying token (LST or ETH) on the next rebalance (which would happen within 24 hours).

2. `epochDeposits < epochRequestedWithdrawals`:

The sandwicher would need to wait 7-9 days (EigenLayer withdrawal delay + up to 2 * 24 hours for rebalances) before his deposit is claimable, but his exchange rate is locked at the moment of request, so he would only lose the opportunity to gain rewards for the next 7-9 days, while not being exposed to the risks the other users are exposed to.

## Impact
Theft of rewards by sandwichers from honest restakers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a delay before LRT can be burned after minting; and/or there should be a delay between the deposit of underlying tokens and minting of LRT.
