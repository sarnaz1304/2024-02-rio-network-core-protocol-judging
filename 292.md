# Incorrect overlap check in swapping validators

## Summary
Index calculation is not correct in checking overlap thus swapping validators revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `swapValidatorDetails` function in `ValidatorDetails` contract, it checks if two segments overlap to prevent swapping overlapping validators:
```Solidity
// forgefmt: disable-next-item
// Ensure no overlap in indexes
if ((startIndex1 < startIndex2 && startIndex1 + keysCount >= startIndex2) || (startIndex2 < startIndex1 && startIndex2 + keysCount >= startIndex1)) {
    revert INDEXES_OVERLAP();
}
```

The issue here is that `startIndex1 + keysCount >= startIndex2` comparison is incorrect, it has to be `>` instead of `>=`.
Because, the last index of first segment is `startIndex1 + keysCount - 1`, so when two segments overlap, it satisfies `startIndex1 + keysCount - 1 >= startIndex2`, thus `startIndex1 + keysCount > startIndex2`.

For example, assume `startIndex1` is 3, `keysCount is 3`, `startIndex2` is 6.
First segment includes indices 3, 4, 5, and the second segment includes indices 6, 7, 8.
Since these two segments do not overlap, it should be able to swap, but from above check, it reverts.

## Impact
Validator swapping feature reverts.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update check as follows:
```Solidity
if ((startIndex1 < startIndex2 && startIndex1 + keysCount > startIndex2) || (startIndex2 < startIndex1 && startIndex2 + keysCount > startIndex1)) {
    revert INDEXES_OVERLAP();
}
```
