# Forbidden third party token transfers on EigenLayer will disable withdrawals

## Summary
Forbidden third party token transfers on EigenLayer will disable withdrawals

## Vulnerability Detail
EigenLayer has a functionality to disable third party token transfers.

```solidity
    function _removeSharesAndQueueWithdrawal(
        address staker, 
        address operator,
        address withdrawer,
        IStrategy[] memory strategies, 
        uint256[] memory shares
    ) internal returns (bytes32) {
    
        ....

            } else {
                require(
=>                  staker == withdrawer || !strategyManager.thirdPartyTransfersForbidden(strategies[i]),
                    "DelegationManager._removeSharesAndQueueWithdrawal: withdrawer must be same address as staker if thirdPartyTransfersForbidden are set"
                );
            }
```

Enabling this disallows withdrawal of tokens to accounts other than the staker. Since the current implementation of Rio withdraws tokens staked by OperatorDelegator to depositPool and withdrawalQueue, this will cause these withdrawals to revert.

## Impact
In case third party token transfers is disabled on EigenLayer, funds cannot be withdrawn

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Withdrawals will have to be made with the OperatorDelegator first receiving the tokens and sending it to withdrawalQueue / depositPool
