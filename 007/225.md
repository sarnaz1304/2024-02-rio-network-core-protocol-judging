# queueWithdrawal may fail as withdrawer is not the same as staker

## Summary
When queuing a withdrawal for LSTs in Eigenlayer, if the specific strategy does not allow 3rd party transfers then the `staker` and `withdrawer` must be the same address. However, in Rio's architecture the OperatorDelegator is the `staker` but the `withdrawer` is either the deposit pool or withdrawal queue. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In RioLRTOperatorDelegator, `queueWithdrawalForUserSettlement()` sets `withdrawalQueue` as the `withdrawer` (for user settlement) and `_queueWithdrawalForOperatorExitOrScrape` sets `depositPool` as the `withdrawer` (for operator exit or rewards scraping):
```solidity
function queueWithdrawalForUserSettlement(address strategy, uint256 shares) external onlyCoordinator returns (bytes32 root) {
	if (strategy == BEACON_CHAIN_STRATEGY) {
		_increaseETHQueuedForUserSettlement(shares);
	}
	root = _queueWithdrawal(strategy, shares, address(withdrawalQueue()));
}


function _queueWithdrawalForOperatorExitOrScrape(address strategy, uint256 shares) internal returns (bytes32 root) {
	if (strategy == BEACON_CHAIN_STRATEGY) {
		_increaseETHQueuedForOperatorExitOrScrape(shares);
	}
	root = _queueWithdrawal(strategy, shares, address(depositPool())); 
}

function _queueWithdrawal(address strategy, uint256 shares, address withdrawer) internal returns (bytes32 root) {
	IDelegationManager.QueuedWithdrawalParams[] memory withdrawalParams = new IDelegationManager.QueuedWithdrawalParams[](1);
        withdrawalParams[0] = IDelegationManager.QueuedWithdrawalParams({
            strategies: strategy.toArray(),
            shares: shares.toArray(),
            withdrawer: withdrawer
        });
        
        //@audit potential revert from eigenlayer as it checks that msg.sender = withdrawer
        root = delegationManager.queueWithdrawals(withdrawalParams)[0];
}
```

However, if third party transfers are forbidden by strategy then the transaction will revert:
https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.1-goerli-m2/src/contracts/core/DelegationManager.sol#L704
```solidity
// Eigenlayer DelegationManager.sol

require(
staker == withdrawer || !strategyManager.thirdPartyTransfersForbidden(strategies[i]),
"DelegationManager._removeSharesAndQueueWithdrawal: withdrawer must be same address as staker if thirdPartyTransfersForbidden are set"
);
```
## Impact
Withdrawals cannot be queued and funds will be permanently stuck in Eigenlayer.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In Eigenlayer's latest [contracts](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/dev/src/contracts/core/DelegationManager.sol#L275), it has been further amended to be an outright check that `withdrawer == staker == msg.sender`, even for native ETH strategy.

Rio may have to consider a redesign of contract architecture to change `withdrawer` to be set as OperatorDelegator, and then subsequently move funds to the desired end locations (depositPool/withdrawalQueue).
