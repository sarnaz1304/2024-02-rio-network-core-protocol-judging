# Lack of slippage control in deposit function(contract RioLRTCoordinator)

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The deposit function of the RioLRTCoordinator contract, enables users to deposit assets into the protocol, getting Restaking tokens in return. The function doesn’t have any type of slippage control; this is relevant in the context of the deposit function, since the amount of tokens received by the user is determined by an interaction with an oracle, meaning that the amount received in return may vary indefinitely while the request is waiting to be executed.

Also the users will have no defence against price manipulations attacks, if they were to be found after the protocol’s deployment.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
An additional parameter could be added to the deposit function, to let users decide the minimum amount of tokens to be received, with a relative check after minting.
