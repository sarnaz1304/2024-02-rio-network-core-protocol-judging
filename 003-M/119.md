# deposit functions in RioLRTCoordinator.sol lack slippage control

## Summary
Missing slippage parameter in deposit functions exposes users to unwanted slippage.
## Vulnerability Detail
Functions `deposit`, `depositETH`, and the `recieve` function which calls an internal function `_depositETH` allow users to deposit ETH and other assets into the protocol to get the RioLRT tokens in return. However these function do not offer any kind of slippage protection/control. This is relevant since the amount of RioLRT tokens (`amountOut`) received by the user is determined by interacting with an oracle meaning that the amount received in return may vary indefinitely while the request is waiting to be executed. Furthermore, users do not have defense against any price manipulation attacks.

## Impact
Missing slippage control exposes users to price fluctuations, potential sandwich attacks which can result to users getting less tokens than needed / funds loss

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow users to specify `minAmountOut` and add check `require (amountOut >= minAmountOut, "Slippage control")` in `deposit` and `_depositETH` functions
