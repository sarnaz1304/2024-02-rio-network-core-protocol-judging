# No slippage protection in depositing

## Summary

No slippage protection in depositing

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `deposit` and `depositETH`, users despoit a certain amount of tokens and obtain corresponding shares. However, the calculation of shares relies on real-time prices and total supply, and the protocol does not provide users with slippage protection, which may result in users receiving much lower shares than expected.

For example, in function `convertToUnitOfAccountFromAsset`, protocol obtains the real-time price and calculates the value, which causes the value to fluctuate with real-time prices.

```solidity
    function convertToUnitOfAccountFromAsset(address asset, uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
        if (asset == ETH_ADDRESS) {
            return amount;
        }
        address priceFeed = assetInfo[asset].priceFeed;
        uint256 price = getPrice(priceFeed);

        return _normalizeDecimals(price * amount / priceScale, assetInfo[asset].decimals, priceFeedDecimals);
    }
```

## Impact

Users receive much lower shares than expected.
