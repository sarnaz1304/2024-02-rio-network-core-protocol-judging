# RioLRTCoordinator.deposit() has no slippage checks

## Summary

RioLRTCoordinator.deposit() has no slippage checks. This results in a user potentially receiving less LRT tokens than they expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user deposits an underlying token into the RioLRTCoordinator via the deposit(), the user can't provide a minimum amount of tokens they want minted. If their transaction is delayed or they are frontrun, the value of the oracle or LRT token may change over time. This can result in the user receiving less LRT tokens than intended. 

Below is a forge test that shows the impact of a change in oracle price which impacts how many LRT tokens a user receives. By toggling the `simulateSlippage ` between true and false, one can view how the number of LRT tokens minted will change.

```solidity
function test_depositERC20SlippageCheck() public {
    bool simulateSlippage = false;
    if (simulateSlippage) {
        (,address priceFeed,,,) = reLST.assetRegistry.assetInfo(CBETH_ADDRESS);
        vm.mockCall(
            priceFeed,
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IPriceFeed.getPrice.selector),
            // AUDIT: price is decreased to simulate slippage
            abi.encode(995500000000000000 * uint(3))
        );
    } else {
        (,address priceFeed,,,) = reLST.assetRegistry.assetInfo(CBETH_ADDRESS);
        vm.mockCall(
            priceFeed,
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IPriceFeed.getPrice.selector),
            abi.encode(1055500000000000000 * uint(3))
        );
    }

    cbETH.approve(address(reLST.coordinator), 20e18);
    reLST.coordinator.deposit(CBETH_ADDRESS, 20e18);

    if (simulateSlippage) {
        console.log("LRT token balance with slippage simulation: ", reLST.token.balanceOf(address(this)));
    } else {
        console.log("LRT token balance: ", reLST.token.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }

    // AUDIT RESULTS:
    // 59730000000000000000 - slippage
    // 63330000000000000000 - no slippage
}
```



## Impact

Users have no way to get a guaranteed amount of LRT tokens and may receive less LRT tokens than expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Provide users a `minAmount` argument when calling deposit() to allow users to receive at minimum an expected amount of tokens.
