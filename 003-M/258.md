# Lack of slippage control on deposits and withdrawals

## Summary

There is no slippage control on deposit and withdrawal.

User lacks control over how many LRT tokens they will receive for their LST deposit (similarly during withdrawal).

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user deposits LST tokens (like RETH, CBETH), the amount of minted LRT tokens (e.g., reETH) is calculated based on the price fetched from an oracle.
The project uses the Chainlink oracle, which has permissible deviations depending on the asset. For example, CBETH/ETH has a 1% deviation, RETH/ETH 2%, STETH/ETH 0.5%.

In dApps, the user is informed about how much they will receive for their deposit at a given moment, but there is no control over the deviation from this number in the `deposit` function.
In the worst-case scenario (with RETH deposit), the user's deposit could lose up to 4%.

A similar situation occurs during the withdrawal request, where the calculation takes place during the function call.

This situation does not occur during ETH deposits (and withdrawals), where the oracle is not used, and only data already included in the system is utilized.

## Impact

The user will receive significantly fewer LRT tokens than expected during the LST deposit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Slippage control should be added, for example, by providing the minimum expected number of tokens in the function.
Example  (`minRSETHAmountExpected`):
