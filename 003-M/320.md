# Lack of slippage control on deposit

## Summary
The deposit function of the RioLRTCoordinator contract, enables users to deposit assets into the protocol, getting reETH tokens in return. The function doesnâ€™t have any type of slippage control; this is relevant in the context of the deposit function, since the amount of tokens received by the user is determined by the total supply and tvl of different assets in protocol. Attacker can manipulate the token issuance  by frontrunning.
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function deposit(address asset, uint256 amountIn) external checkDeposit(asset, amountIn) returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        // Convert deposited asset amount to restaking tokens.
        amountOut = convertFromAssetToRestakingTokens(asset, amountIn);

        // Pull tokens from the sender to the deposit pool.
        IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(depositPool()), amountIn);

        // Mint restaking tokens to the caller.
        token.mint(msg.sender, amountOut);

        emit Deposited(msg.sender, asset, amountIn, amountOut);
    }
```
Total token minted is related to its totalSupply and the total value of all the deposited assets. This can lead to to the manipulation

```solidity
function convertFromUnitOfAccountToRestakingTokens(uint256 value) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 tvl = getTVL();
        uint256 supply = token.totalSupply();

        if (supply == 0) {
            return value;
        }
        return value * supply / tvl;
    }
```
Here, when someone tries to deposit large tokens, attacker might front run and directly deposit the accepted tokens to the deposit pool(). As a result amount of tokens to be received is affected.

## Impact
User might not get the expected tokens in return after there deposit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
An additional parameter could be added to the deposit function, to let users decide the minimum amount of tokens to be received.
