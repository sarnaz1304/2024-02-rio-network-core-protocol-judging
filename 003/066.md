# Fixed Gas Limit in transferETH Can Lead to Fund Freezing and Griefing

## Summary
The **transferETH** function within the smart contract presents a vulnerability due to its use of a fixed gas limit of 10,000 for ETH transfers. This limitation can be exploited by a recipient contract with receive or fallback functions that require more than 10,000 gas, resulting in the transaction's failure and potential freezing of funds. This vulnerability allows for griefing attacks, as malicious actors can intentionally cause transactions to fail, undermining user confidence and disrupting protocol operations without directly stealing funds or affecting governance.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Fixed Gas Limit in **transferETH** Can Lead to Fund Freezing and Griefing" in the provided code is that the gas limit for the transfer of ETH is hardcoded to 10,000 in line 42. This fixed gas limit may not be sufficient for all scenarios, especially if the recipient contract requires more gas to process the transaction.

If the recipient contract requires more gas than the hardcoded limit of 10,000, the transaction will fail and revert in line 44, causing the funds to be stuck in the contract. This can lead to fund freezing and griefing as the sender may not be able to retrieve their funds or interact with the contract further.

The vulnerability in the code lies in line 42 where a fixed gas limit of 10,000 is set for the transfer of ETH to the recipient. This fixed gas limit can lead to a denial of service attack where an attacker can intentionally consume all the gas provided for the transaction, causing it to fail and potentially freezing the funds in the contract.

Proof of Concept (PoC) code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    
    function transferETH(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        (bool success,) = recipient.call{value: amount, gas: 10_000}('');
        if (!success) {
            revert "ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED";
        }
    }
    
    function exploit(address payable recipient) public payable {
        // Call the transferETH function with a large amount of ETH
        transferETH(recipient, msg.value);
    }
    
    // Fallback function to receive ETH
    receive() external payable {}
}
```
In this PoC code, an attacker can call the **exploit** function with a large amount of ETH, causing the **transferETH** function to fail due to the fixed gas limit of 10,000. This can result in the funds being frozen in the contract and potentially lead to griefing.

## Impact
The issue lies in the inflexible gas stipulation, which does not account for variable gas requirements of contract interactions, leading to unbounded gas consumption issues and hindering the contract's ability to fulfill its ETH transfer commitments.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, the gas limit should be set dynamically based on the gas required by the recipient contract. One way to do this is by using the gasleft() function to determine the remaining gas and pass it to the call function.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to fix the issue:

```solidity
41       function transferETH(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
42           (bool success,) = recipient.call{value: amount, gas: gasleft()}('');
43           if (!success) {
44               revert ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED();
45           }
46       }
```
By using gasleft() to dynamically set the gas limit, the recipient contract will have enough gas to process the transaction successfully, preventing the freezing of funds and potential griefing attacks.
