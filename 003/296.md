# Asset.sol#transferETH() - 10_000 gas might not be enough for account abstractions

## Summary
10_000 gas might not be enough for account abstractions

## Vulnerability Detail
Account abstraction wallets have been on the rise for quite a time now and are used by a lot of users.

A lot of wallets/multisigs have some sort of logic inside their `receive/fallback` functions.

This will be a problem in the context of `transferETH` because very little gas is being sent to the `recipient` address, which will not be enough in a lot of cases.

```solidity
function transferETH(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        //@audit-issue possible return bomb
        //@audit-issue possible force revert
        (bool success,) = recipient.call{value: amount, gas: 10_000}('');
        if (!success) {
            revert ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED();
        }
```

Because `transferETH` is used inside `transferTo`, and `transferTo` is used inside `claimWithdrawalsForEpoch`, if the tx reverts, because the contract didn't have enough gas to execute, the funds will be stuck and will become unclaimable, as `withdrawer` is always `msg.sender`

## Impact
Funds will be frozen and users that use multisigs/account abstractions won't be able to claim their funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Forward more gas, so that the tx's doesn't revert.
