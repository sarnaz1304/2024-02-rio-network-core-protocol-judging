# RioLRTOperatorDelegator is unable to receive ether

## Summary

RioLRTOperatorDelegator runs out of gas when forwarding ETH from its `receive` function due to RioLRTRewardDistributor spending more than 10,000 gas.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [RioLRTOperatorDelegator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTOperatorDelegator.sol#L245) forwards ETH received to the RioLRTRewardDistributor contract. It does so using [Asset::transferETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/utils/Asset.sol#L42) which limits the gas passed to 10,000.

```solidity
    /// @notice Forwards ETH rewards to the reward distributor. This includes partial
    /// withdrawals and any amount in excess of 32 ETH for full withdrawals.
    receive() external payable {
        address(rewardDistributor()).transferETH(msg.value);
    }
```

```solidity
    function transferETH(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        (bool success,) = recipient.call{value: amount, gas: 10_000}('');
        if (!success) {
            revert ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED();
        }
    }
```

However, [RioLRTRewardDistributor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rio-network-core-protocol/blob/4f01e065c1ed346875cf5b05d2b43e0bcdb4c849/rio-sherlock-audit/contracts/restaking/RioLRTRewardDistributor.sol#L82-L94) spends more than 10,000 gas in its receive function:

```solidity
    /// @notice Receives ETH and distributes it to the treasury, operator, and deposit pool.
    receive() external payable {
        uint256 value = msg.value;

        uint256 treasuryShare = value * treasuryETHValidatorRewardShareBPS / MAX_BPS;
        uint256 operatorShare = value * operatorETHValidatorRewardShareBPS / MAX_BPS;
        uint256 poolShare = value - treasuryShare - operatorShare;

        if (treasuryShare > 0) treasury.transferETH(treasuryShare);
        if (operatorShare > 0) operatorRewardPool.transferETH(operatorShare);
        if (poolShare > 0) address(depositPool()).transferETH(poolShare);

        emit ETHValidatorRewardsDistributed(treasuryShare, operatorShare, poolShare);
    }
```

Note that simply executing 5 `SLOAD` to read `treasuryETHValidatorRewardShareBPS`, `operatorETHValidatorRewardShareBPS`, `treasury`, `operatorRewardPool` and `depositPool()` adds up to $2100*5=10500$ gas. Therefore the call will always revert and RioLRTOperatorDelegator won't be able to receive and forward ETH.

## Impact

RioLRTOperatorDelegator cannot receive ETH, which "includes partial withdrawals and any amount in excess of 32 ETH for full withdrawals."

## Recommendation

Either increase the gas limit of Asset::transferETH or forward the ETH in two steps.
