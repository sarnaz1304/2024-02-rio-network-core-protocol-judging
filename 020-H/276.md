# Operators can steal ETH by front running validator registration

## Summary
Operators can steal ETH by front running validator registration

## Vulnerability Detail
For pre-existing validators, further staking via the beacon deposit contract act as topups and [doesn't verify the withdrawal credentials and signature](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/deposits-withdrawals/deposit-processing/#validator-top-ups). This allows an operator to steal the about to be staked ETH by adding the validator beforehand with a different withdrawal address controlled by the operator. The security review timeframe of 24hrs in which the admin has control to remove the validators can be bypassed by only adding the validator after this confirmation timestamp.

## Impact
Operators can steal the about to be staked ETH

## Code Snippet
staking of 32 eth is done without necessary precautions

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make an initial deposit, ideally with 1 ETH from operators and verify the withdrawal credentials before staking user's ETH / Acknowledge operator trust and handle this via some other punishment mechanism for the operator
