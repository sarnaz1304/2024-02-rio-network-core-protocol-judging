# M-4 : Discrepancy in avs activation

## Summary
AVS Activation event can misguide off-chain users and services serving as core to the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
Inside AVS registration and AVS activation , the zero address slashing contract is being allowed.
And Activation Event is being emitted even when slashing contract is not configured correctlly.

_activateAVS()_

```solidity
 if (avs.slashingContract != address(0)) {
            _isActiveSlashingContract[avs.slashingContract] = true;
        }
        _isActiveRegistryContract[avs.registryContract] = true;

        emit AVSActivated(avsId);
```

The outer world services would think that this AVS is completely configured but it is not.
Confusing other off-chain services to behave differently than intended

## Impact
Protocol off-chain services will behave other than intended based upon incorrect details about activation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not allow activation if slashing contract is much important for the protocol avs service to function correctly.
